initial public offering of shares of Class A common stock by Circle Internet Group, Inc. We are offering &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; shares of Class A common stock and the selling stockholders identified in this prospectus are offering
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; shares of Class A common stock. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock by the selling stockholders. The initial public offering price is expected to be between
$&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; and $&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; per share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:9pt; font-family:arial">Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock. We
have applied to list our Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the &#147;NYSE&#148;) under the symbol &#147;CRCL&#148;. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:9pt; font-family:arial">Upon completion of this
offering, we will have three authorized series of common stock: Class A common stock, which is entitled to one vote per share; Class B common stock, which is entitled to 5 votes per share (but the aggregate voting power of Class B common stock
cannot exceed 30% of the total voting power of our capital stock); and Class C common stock, which does not have any voting power other than to the extent set forth in our certificate of incorporation or otherwise required by applicable law. Holders
of our common stock vote together as a single class on all matters, except as otherwise set forth in our certificate of incorporation or as required by applicable law. Our Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock on a
one-for-one basis at the option of the holder. In addition, our Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis upon any transfer, except for permitted transfers described in our certificate of
incorporation, and in certain other circumstances. Our Class C common stock is convertible into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis in connection with certain assignments and transfers. Our Class B common stock, which will be held by our
founders Jeremy Allaire and Patrick Sean Neville and certain entities controlled by our founders, will represent approximately &#8195;&#8195;% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock following this offering (or approximately
&#8195;&#8195;% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). Upon the completion of this offering, we will not be a &#147;controlled company&#148; within
the meaning of the NYSE&#146;s corporate governance standards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:9pt; font-family:arial"><B>Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. See &#147;<A HREF="#rom737521_3">Risk

execution that leads us here today. I also want to share with you my thoughts on what it means for Circle to become a public company, and how I think about Circle&#146;s role in the global financial system in the coming decade. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>Becoming an internet maximalist </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">I was fortunate to have been brought up with
an Apple II computer in my home, and gained access to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-internet</FONT> online world in the early 1980s. With limited means, this was a big deal. I was also brought up by parents whose worldview and moral
philosophy was shaped by the idea that if we could connect more deeply with people, and connect people around the world, that we could drive transformative and positive outcomes for the world. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As a political science, philosophy, and economics student in college, my worldview was anchored in a belief that countries with free information and free markets who
connected and traded together would lead to a world of greater political and economic stability. It was during that time, in 1990, that I got hooked on the internet&#151;the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-commercial</FONT> version of
command-lines, weird message boards, and disparate servers filled with random scientific and government data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">It was in those moments that I became an internet
maximalist. It was as clear as day to me that open global computer networks, connected through open technology protocols that anyone could build on and use, would lead to a wholesale transformation of society and the economy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">I spent the next 20 years committing myself to building out internet software platforms and infrastructure that helped to realize those ideas. I ultimately <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-founded</FONT> and helped to lead and take public two global internet technology firms through the Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 eras, when the open internet transformed software, media, communications, and retail commerce in
irreversible and ultimately unpredictable ways. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>The great financial crisis&#151;an inflection point </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Also nearly 20 years into my journey as an internet maximalist, the world went through this century&#146;s most significant global financial crisis. The 1990s and 2000s
had represented a period of dramatic economic growth and globalization, and the internet had surely played no small part in fostering that economic velocity. But it all came crashing down in 2008. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As a student of political economy, I needed to understand what happened. This huge part of the global economic system&#151;the financial services industry&#151;had
failed us massively. As I dug into the history of banking, money, central banking, and the international monetary system, I became convinced that we needed a new architecture for the financial system, one that was rooted in the internet&#151;built
on open networks, open software, and global integration&#151;and eventually one where full-reserve digital currency can be intermediated with internet-based credit markets to create what could ultimately become a safer financial system. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">It was during this time of personal exploration that I stumbled across Bitcoin in 2012. While I was not sold on the idea that Bitcoin itself would become the answer,
within it I found a revolutionary combination of technical innovation and philosophical alignment around the idea of an open, internet-based alternative financial system. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>Circle&#146;s founding and vision </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In early 2013, after immersing in the

internet was being born, one that provided a new set of open protocols that would do to the exchange of value what earlier protocols had done to the exchange of data and communications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">While it was not possible at the time, as technologists, it was clear to the two of us that blockchains would evolve to enable the issuance of digital tokens
representing other assets, would allow for the execution of code in the form of smart contracts, and ultimately allow one to build higher-level protocols for money. This was going to be bigger and more impactful than the Web was, because this could
transform not just information but the entire global economic system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We envisioned the development of an &#147;HTTP for Money,&#148; a protocol for dollars and
other fiat digital currency tokens that would provide an open and programmable infrastructure to rebuild the global financial system in the image of the internet. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">For both of us, two key implications were extremely clear. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">First, the natural
outcome would be that blockchains would reach scale, speed, and efficiency, and that such a protocol for dollars on the internet would lead to a world where the storage and transmission of value (fiat money value) would be commoditized, which would
accelerate the velocity of money and also return trillions in value to the real economy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Second, the fact that digital currency protocols would be programmable
using smart contracts meant that there would ultimately be a massive transformation in the utility of money, and that new &#147;money blocks&#148; would emerge that could transform finance, trade, commerce, and the very foundation of capital
markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>Building and executing on the mission and vision </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As an early
pioneer in the digital assets and blockchain industry, I believe Circle stands out from the rest of the crowd. I believe that the path we took toward our mission statement (&#147;to increase global economic prosperity through the frictionless
exchange of value&#148;) differentiates us from others. We knew that to achieve this mission, to build a world where dollar digital currency was possible at scale, we needed to take a different approach than those focused on growing investments and
trading in speculative cryptocurrencies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">There were several key principles that informed the development of Circle: </P>

building an internet financial system. </TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:8pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

principles of execution enabled Circle to move through the early stage of the market with agility and strength, and to ultimately give us the capabilities and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> to launch USDC in 2018. Seven years into
our journey, our vision of a programmable protocol for dollars on the internet would be born. Although we have encountered challenges and risks in the past and will no doubt continue to face new and existing ones in the future, I believe that Circle
is well positioned to be a crucial part of the infrastructure of the new internet financial system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>What we&#146;ve accomplished </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Today, Circle is a globally recognized and respected brand and company, with a reputation for integrity and transparency, as both an advocate and leader in building the
internet financial system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Since its launch in 2018, USDC, as the core of the Circle stablecoin network, has been used for more than $25&nbsp;trillion in onchain
transactions as of March 28, 2025. Millions of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-users</FONT> use USDC for payments, settlements, and as a digital dollar store of value. Thousands of companies and developers have integrated with USDC, creating a
thriving ecosystem. Major payments companies, enterprise technology firms, consumer internet applications, financial technology (&#147;FinTech&#148;) firms, and digital asset companies use Circle technology to power solutions built on USDC. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">And USDC has continued to be built on strong market infrastructure and underlying liquidity, with Circle having minted more than $504.3&nbsp;billion of USDC and redeemed
more than $464.4&nbsp;billion of USDC from January&nbsp;1, 2021 to December 31, 2024&#151;redemptions that have always been one-for-one with the U.S. dollar. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We
have faced challenges. For example, in 2023, USDC went through an extended period of circulation decline related to a number of factors, including an increase in U.S. short-term interest rates, a decline in digital asset prices, and an associated
decline in leverage in the digital asset trading ecosystem, as well as the impact of a temporary price dislocation in the secondary markets in March 2023 resulting from the collapse of certain U.S. regional banks that caused some market share to
move to a competitor. We will no doubt continue to face challenges in the future. Nonetheless, the growth of USDC and the Circle stablecoin network has shown resilience and allowed us to become a strong and thriving business in a short period of
time. With just $15.4&nbsp;million in revenue in 2020, we grew to $84.9&nbsp;million in revenue and reserve income in 2021, $772.0&nbsp;million in revenue and reserve income in 2022, $1.5 billion in revenue and reserve income in 2023, and $1.7
billion in revenue and reserve income in 2024. In 2024, we reported $156 million in net income and $285 million in Adjusted EBITDA. As of December&nbsp;31, 2024, we had total liquidity sources of $1,045 million, which consisted of $751 million in
cash and cash equivalents and $294 million in cash and cash equivalents segregated for corporate-held stablecoins. During this time, we have also built a team with diverse and global backgrounds, spanning more than a dozen countries and more than 35
U.S. states and territories. This team heralds from leading internet, technology, and financial services firms, and we believe brings the necessary skills to build this new internet financial system. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Circle is a product- and technology-led company, and we have made and will continue to make significant investments in product and technology development and build
long-term value in the market. </P>

Exchange is a continuation of our desire to operate with the greatest transparency and accountability possible. We are building what we believe to be critical infrastructure for the financial system, and we seek to work with leading companies and
governments around the world in shaping and building this new internet financial system. Operating as a U.S.-listed public company represents our continued dedication to transparency and accountability, as we will become subject to the reporting,
corporate governance, and other requirements that are applicable to a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">But more than anything, going public now
is representative of the fact that we are at a significant crossroads for Circle and the development of the internet financial system. We see the opportunity before us as being informed and strengthened by a combination of technology readiness,
regulatory clarity, and market need. It is complex and occurs at the intersection between highly innovative technology and financial services. While we are proud and confident about our ability to pursue this opportunity, our future (like our past)
is rife with uncertainties and risks that we must navigate successfully. In fact, we have dedicated a large part of this prospectus to describe those risks and I encourage you to read them in the &#147;Risk factors&#148; section. Becoming a public
company enables us to allow the general public to come with us for the journey. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>A long-term approach and philosophy </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">If you choose to become an investor in Circle, it&#146;s very important that you understand our approach and philosophy to building value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We are building for the very long term, as evidenced by our clear-eyed founding vision more than 10 years ago. We think that we can create a new defining internet
platform company that is built on the internet financial system. And we believe that we are still in the very early stages in the development of this new financial system. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We believe we are only scratching the surface of what is possible, and see meaningful opportunity to build and grow ahead of us. This will mean investment where we see
meaningful long-term growth potential. Given how early we are in the development of this market, the size of the market opportunity, and the complexity, challenges, and potential obstacles we face, we intend to continue to invest significantly to
grow for the foreseeable future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Most importantly of all, we will continue to build and lead the company by being deeply grounded in our core mission and values.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>We don&#146;t fit in a box </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We like to say that Circle is a unique
company. If you ask any of our investors or employees, or even the market as a whole, I think you&#146;ll hear this too. But from a public market perspective, it&#146;s important to know this&#151;we don&#146;t fit in a box. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Some may say we are like a payments company, others like a financial institution, and still others like a consumer internet or platform software company. The reality is
that we&#146;re a little bit like all of these kinds of companies. </P>

regulatory-first posture in which we prioritize compliance with applicable regulations and our engagement with regulators and policymakers to facilitate designing and tailoring appropriate regulation for our industry. </P>

easy given the complexity of navigating an evolving ecosystem where innovative technology and highly regulated, legacy financial services are intersecting in ways that will give rise to challenges and uncertainties. Building a new internet financial
system, creating major new infrastructure for money and economic activity, shaping and responding to policy, and operating this infrastructure in a complex global macro environment&#151;well, it&#146;s hard. It&#146;s complex and difficult, and will
challenge you every day. But it is also an exciting financial and technological adventure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We have a crystal clear vision of what a future internet financial system

the term &#147;customer&#148; to refer to Circle Mint customers. Circle Mint is our service offering that provides institutional customers USDC- and EURC-related services, such as minting USDC and EURC, redeeming USDC and EURC for the U.S. dollar
and euro, respectively, directly from us, and sending and receiving USDC and EURC to and/or from Circle Mint accounts. Circle Mint supports international wires and domestic bank transfers in more than 185 countries, a list of which is available on
our website at https://www.circle.com/en/circle-mint (although the information contained therein or connected thereto is not incorporated into this prospectus or the registration statement of which it forms a part). Circle Mint is currently
available only to institutions, such as exchanges, institutional traders, wallet providers, banks, and consumer apps companies. Circle Mint is not available to individuals; as such, no individuals are Circle Mint customers. To open a Circle Mint
account, a potential customer must submit an application in which such potential customer provides us with compliance information and supporting documentation, including, but not limited to, the legal entity, its operations, beneficial owners, and
the intended use of the account. Potential Circle Mint customers must pass our screening processes, including, but not limited to, ID verification, know-your-customer (&#147;KYC&#148;) checks, sanctions screening, and suitability checks (for which
we consider factors such as the type of business the potential customer engages in and the potential customer&#146;s anticipated minting volume). Circle Mint customers are able to mint Circle stablecoins and redeem Circle stablecoins directly from
us. In contrast, we use the term &#147;end-user&#148; to refer to a holder of USDC or EURC, regardless of whether such end-user is a Circle Mint customer. An end-user of USDC or EURC that is not a Circle Mint customer cannot mint USDC or EURC;
rather, to acquire USDC or EURC, the end-user must purchase USDC and EURC in the secondary market, which may include transactions with a Circle Mint customer or another end-user that is not a Circle Mint customer. An end-user that is not a Circle
Mint customer may exchange USDC and EURC for fiat currency by selling USDC and EURC in the secondary market, which may include transactions with a Circle Mint customer or another end-user that is not a Circle Mint customer. Alternatively, an
end-user that is not a Circle Mint customer can also redeem USDC and EURC directly from us in our role as the redeemer of last resort, which is described below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Transactions between third parties may be subject to fees charged by the parties to the transaction or the secondary marketplace on which the transaction occurs. These
fees, as well as the terms of such transactions, are governed by agreements between the parties to the transactions and/or the rules of the secondary marketplace on which the transactions occur. An end-user that is an institution and not a Circle

(&#147;MiCAR&#148;) to redeem all USDC and EURC presented to it for redemption on a one-for-one basis for U.S. dollars and euros, respectively, regardless of whether the holder is a Circle Mint customer. A Circle Mint customer may redeem USDC and
EURC through its Circle Mint account. As required by MiCAR, an end-user that is not a Circle Mint customer may redeem USDC and EURC directly from Circle Internet Financial Europe SAS after providing compliance information and supporting
documentation, including, but not limited to, a notarized copy of such end-user&#146;s government identification or business formation documents, as applicable, a bank statement in such end-user&#146;s name from a bank located in the EEA that is
able to receive U.S. dollars or single euro payments area (&#147;SEPA&#148;) payments, as applicable, and other documentation required to complete our screening (which includes but is not limited to, ID verification, KYC checks, and sanctions
screening). In practice, however, given the marketplace for USDC and EURC, it is generally less cumbersome for a non-Circle Mint customer to sell USDC and EURC in the secondary market than to redeem USDC and EURC directly from us. Nonetheless,
Circle Internet Financial Europe SAS is obligated to honor, and does honor, all properly presented redemption requests for USDC and EURC (other than when prohibited by law or court order or instances where fraud is suspected), which obligation we
refer to as our role as the &#147;redeemer of last resort.&#148; We do not charge fees for redemptions effected in our role as the redeemer of last resort. </P>

that with the advent of blockchain networks, the global financial system can be rebuilt on the principles of the internet&#151;those of open software and public networks&#151;to the benefit of all of society. This new internet financial system has
the potential to address the structural inefficiencies of the legacy financial system, enabling value to be exchanged more quickly, more cheaply, more safely, and in new, innovative ways&#151;thereby increasing both the benefit of and access to the
financial system for all people and all businesses across the globe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Finance is fundamentally built upon the movement of money in the form of the transmission of
data, wrapped in trust, and protected by regulation.</I>&#8195; Finance is built upon the movement of money. In modern digital finance, the movement of money is the movement of data between accounts in private, permissioned databases. This movement
of money is typically tightly controlled and regulated by individual nations to ensure safety and soundness of the financial system and to protect against abuse by bad actors. Although the infrastructure system enabling this movement of money is
critical to the functioning of the existing financial system and powers one of the largest sectors in the global economy, the technology underpinning this system in large part dates from the 1970s and 1980s. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Today</I><I>&#146;</I><I>s financial system has brought countless benefits, yet inefficiencies remain stubbornly high.&#8195; </I>The financial system has enabled
massive societal advances, lifting billions of people out of extreme poverty and contributing to enormous economic growth. Technological advancements have enabled innovations such as credit cards, electronic payments, and electronic capital markets.
Yet despite this history of progress, and despite intense competition, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-user</FONT> costs and systemic inefficiencies persist. Modern FinTech firms have generally focused on modernizing <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">front-end</FONT> interfaces but still often rely on legacy infrastructure, limiting true innovation. We believe the next innovation in the exchange of value, which is our core focus at Circle, will drive an evolution in
the underlying infrastructure of the financial system that meets critical market demand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The internet revolutionized the transmission of data, bringing
exponential growth and previously unimagined innovation to countless sectors. Likewise, the internet has the potential to transform today&#146;s financial system</I>.&#8195; The advent of the internet enabled &#147;all-to-all&#148; communication at
vastly lower costs by advancing communication from tightly controlled analog rails (e.g., radio, telephone, cable) to standardized network protocols. These protocols enabled new infrastructure for the movement of data and information. While adoption
took time, and early use cases initially both struggled to scale and encountered meaningful scrutiny, over time, more innovators and developers began building on the internet and more users connected to the network via the applications they built.
The end result: the cost of communication has approached zero at point of use, the volume of communication has exploded, and previously unimaginable services have now emerged. Today, the leaders of the modern digital economy are built on internet
rails, and more of the economy is transitioning to these rails each day. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Blockchain networks enable the creation of the internet financial system.&#8195; </I>Blockchains provide a new base
layer of internet infrastructure that uses advancements in cryptography and distributed computing to enable secure data exchange, transaction processing, and computation. These advancements make new categories of applications on the internet
possible, including issuing digital financial assets, efficiently exchanging and processing transactions involving these assets, and writing code that can intermediate more complex transactions. Importantly, these blockchain networks can operate
openly on the internet, reducing society&#146;s dependence on centralized intermediaries while unlocking efficiencies. We believe that blockchains could serve as a robust foundation for the creation of a new financial system built from the ground up
on the internet&#151;what we call<I> the new internet financial system</I>. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>This new internet financial system has the potential to substantially reduce
inefficiencies in today&#146;s financial system</I>.&#8195; Given the amount of value being exchanged in today&#146;s financial system, the benefits of increased efficiency are vast. Trillions of dollars in payments and cross-border remittances
occur annually, often at high costs due to the complex (often multi-party) legacy rails on which they flow. Vast sums of capital are trapped in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">multi-day</FONT> settlement in capital markets, rather than deployed to
productive uses. Immense operational, counterparty, and liquidity risks exist due to the opacity of financial exposures, outdated, manual workflows, and a dependence on cash held in fractional reserve banks. The internet financial system has the
potential to address these inefficiencies by reducing cost and latency, enhancing transparency, and using safer underlying collateral. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The new internet financial
system enables significantly increased money velocity.</I>&#8195; While the potential efficiency benefits of the internet financial system are staggering, we believe these are just a subset of the potential benefits it brings. As the marginal cost
of storing and moving value approaches zero, conditions are ripe for the volume of value exchange to increase exponentially, similar to how the volume of information exchange exploded as the marginal cost of moving data on the internet approached
zero. In such a future, we expect that both the velocity and versatility of money will increase dramatically, as people and businesses are able to transact more freely and frictionlessly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The new internet financial system opens up new opportunities and use cases in finance and commerce through the advent of smart contracts running on
blockchains.</I>&#8195; We believe programmability of money and digital assets represents a major inflection point in the utility of money. Economic arrangements can be literally codified, executed, and enforced entirely online, enabling people and
firms across the world to safely enter into internet-based financial and commercial arrangements, while reducing the need for third-party intermediaries. And, just as the Web and App Stores led to an explosion in innovative information services, the
growth of smart contracts and blockchain-based applications could significantly accelerate innovation in financial services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The new internet financial system
has the potential to increase economic inclusion among underserved populations</I>.&#8195; The existing financial system&#146;s inefficiencies result in the exclusion of certain segments of the global population, particularly those who are poorer,
less educated, and living in rural areas. The new internet financial system has the potential to facilitate the inclusion of the approximately 1.4&nbsp;billion adults globally who, according to the World Bank, are unbanked. The increased inclusion

adoption of the new internet financial system. Specifically, we believe that payment stablecoins are the new base layer of internet money. Payment stablecoins function at internet speed
(near-instantaneous transacting and settlement), and with programmability that enables the new capabilities and use cases of the internet financial system. The USDC &#147;digital dollar&#148; issued by us is a leading payment stablecoin, with
$43.9&nbsp;billion in circulation across 4.3&nbsp;million meaningful wallets, as of December 31, 2024. We believe that payment stablecoins, their users and applications, and the use cases built around them will create internet-scale network effects,
leading to a market structure in which only a few payment stablecoin platforms will emerge with the critical mass to serve the new internet financial system. We believe that the Circle stablecoin network is best placed to be a driver of the new
internet financial system. See &#147;&#151;Stablecoin overview&#148; for a more detailed description of payment stablecoins. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Our strategy is to build the largest
and most widely used stablecoin network in the world</I>.&#8195; Money (and any other store or representation of value) is fundamentally a network, whose utility is dependent on the number of users using it and willing to accept it. In other words,
the more users in the network using or willing to use a form of value, the more utility that form of value has, which in turn promotes more people to use it. This is the case with stablecoins as well: The more people that use a stablecoin, the more
utility it has to users (as a store of value and a method of transacting), which in turn drives more people to use it. Furthermore, stablecoins act as protocols that applications and developers build on top of and integrate. Protocols themselves
have network properties&#151;the more applications and products connected to the protocols, the more value the network develops through both utility and distribution. USDC is the foundation of the Circle stablecoin network, the growth of which is
driven by developers building new applications and use cases on the network that are accessible and provide utility to end-users across the world. Attracting end-users, customers, and developers to adopt the Circle stablecoin network requires that
the underlying infrastructure of the digital currencies on the network be robust and safe. Although the Circle stablecoin network carries risks to our customers and end-users, as is the case with the existing financial system, we nonetheless believe
it optimally combines transparency and safety&#151;through regulation as stored-value instruments under Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#147;FinCEN&#148;) money services businesses regulation and state money transmission laws in the United
States and as electronic money tokens in Europe, robust and frequent reporting (e.g., daily transparency into the Circle Reserve Fund), monthly assurance, and annual audits&#151;with the demonstrated reach, critical mass of end-users, world-class
financial partners, and network activity to drive the compounding growth and flywheel of internet-scale network effects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Our growth strategy is to build and
promote a suite of products that foster the expansion of the Circle stablecoin network.</I>&#8195; Our product strategy is aimed at growing the Circle stablecoin network and the circulation of Circle stablecoins. To that end, we strive to ensure
that Circle Mint customers have readily available access to Circle stablecoins around the globe by working with financial institutions that act as on- and off-ramps between fiat currency and Circle stablecoins as well as with leading consumer
financial applications and payments enterprises. See &#147;&#151;Our platform, products, and ecosystem&#148; for examples of partners that are part of the Circle stablecoin network and the Circle stablecoin ecosystem. We build and support stablecoin
infrastructure that is designed to enable Circle stablecoins to flow safely and easily across blockchain networks and remove friction and complexity in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-user</FONT> experience for stablecoin transactions.
Finally, we provide <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">easy-to-use,</FONT></FONT> cloud-based tools that aim to simplify the underlying technology for developers (whether at startups or within major institutions), and

partner with leading institutions (many of them category-leading, internet-scale companies) to bring the benefits of the internet financial system to their users by building upon our products. Examples of our partnership strategy include the recent
launches of the first phases of our partnership with Grab to offer its customers in Singapore a decentralized, blockchain-based (Web3) wallet via the Grab app, our partnership with Mercado Libre to introduce its customers in Latin America to USDC,
our partnership with Nubank to introduce its customers in Brazil to USDC, our partnership with SBI Holdings to expand USDC access in Japan, our partnership with Coins.ph to help Filipinos abroad learn to use USDC for remittances, and our alliance
with Binance to promote USDC on its platform. We have also partnered with Coinbase to provide seamless conversion between fiat currency and USDC. In addition, we collaborate with leading global market makers and liquidity providers. For example, in
December 2024, we entered into an agreement with Cumberland to expand liquidity and settlement capabilities in USYC and USDC over the course of a three-year term. To further serve our goal, we have also entered into an arrangement with
Intercontinental Exchange Holdings, Inc. (&#147;ICE&#148;) to explore integrating Circle stablecoins and USYC as collateral, settlement, and co-branded exchange-traded products across ICE&#146;s derivative markets. We also foster the Circle
stablecoin ecosystem with a range of programs, including Circle Developer Programs, which sponsor hackathons and developer events, the Circle Alliance Program, our global partnership and alliance program, as well as worldwide industry and event
sponsorships. Each of these partnerships drives awareness and growth of the Circle stablecoin network, further enhancing its network effect. We further believe we are uniquely well positioned to attract new partners due to our and USDC&#146;s

rates at a discount to the prevailing SOFR. We believe that our current revenue model has been successful, with 2024 revenue, net income, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion, $156 million, and $285 million, respectively. See &#147;Management&#146;s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations&#151;Non-GAAP financial measures&#148; for reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA. As the Circle stablecoin network grows and as more applications and activity take

yield-bearing investments for collateral use in capital markets. We believe that certain major trading firms have moved, and will increasingly move away from, using stablecoins as collateral in favor of TMMFs. However, other TMMF issuers may be
limited in their ability to provide significant instantaneous redeemability for equivalent underlying assets. We believe that the ability of a well-regulated stablecoin such as USDC to provide near-instantaneous redemption can offer a substantial
advantage for this emerging trend of using TMMFs as collateral for margin trading on various digital asset trading platforms, maximizing capital efficiency in the flows between settlement assets and collateral and at the same time, reducing
counterparty execution risk. Moreover, TMMF issuers typically operate on a single blockchain or have limited interoperability across different blockchain platforms. By integrating TMMFs with Circle&#146;s existing infrastructure, we expect to
enhance interoperability and enable investors to quickly transition between TMMFs </P>

data, transactions, and computing resources, all crucial building blocks for building financial and commercial applications. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:8pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Across the Circle stablecoin network, we aim to enable simpler, safer, and easier to use applications. Because our stablecoin infrastructure exists entirely as public
protocols and public infrastructure itself, it can be used by all users of the internet and does not require a user to interact with us directly. The more broadly this infrastructure is used and supported, the greater the quality and reach of the
Circle stablecoin network. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">To this end, we build, deliver, and operate a range of blockchain-specific software infrastructure. This blockchain infrastructure is
intended to abstract away certain complexities associated with using blockchain networks, and to simplify the usage of Circle stablecoins, all while increasing convenience and safety. Said differently, this infrastructure is important to enhancing
the utility of Circle stablecoins on the internet, and therefore we work within the broader developer and blockchain ecosystem to adopt this technology rather than directly offering these as commercial products. Our blockchain infrastructure
includes open-source software, deployed smart contract protocols, and related network services that help make using Circle stablecoins safe, efficient, and reliable. </P>

market infrastructure for stablecoin and blockchain applications. Today, USDC and the Circle stablecoin network play a crucial role in the emerging internet financial system. By offering Circle stablecoins on open blockchain networks and protocols,
we have been able to build and become part of a broad global ecosystem of companies, products, and technologies that make up the new internet financial system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The
value of the Circle stablecoin network grows as more companies and services connect into our network and infrastructure, growing the reach and utility of our network. To understand the scale and scope of our value, it is important to also understand
the broader Circle stablecoin ecosystem. Altogether, thousands of companies are part of the Circle stablecoin ecosystem, providing products and technologies that integrate with the Circle stablecoin network in various ways. </P>

Circle stablecoin reserves. In compliance with applicable laws and regulatory guidance, we (i) limit Circle stablecoin reserves to highly liquid financial instruments, (ii) hold reserves in accounts that are titled FBO holders of USDC and EURC,
respectively, and (iii) do not lend, borrow against, or encumber the reserves. See &#147;Business&#151;Regulatory policy landscape&#151;Principal U.S. federal and state regulatory regimes&#151;Money transmitter and money services laws&#148; for a

government money market fund pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;) managed by BlackRock, one of the world&#146;s largest asset managers, and available only to us. The assets within the
Circle Reserve Fund are held in the custody of The Bank of New York Mellon (&#147;BNY&#148;), one of the largest asset custodians in the world. See &#147;Management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations&#151;Liquidity and capital resources&#151;Composition of USDC reserves&#148; for additional information regarding the Circle Reserve Fund. The remaining portion of USDC reserves (typically 10-20%) are held as cash in accounts that are
titled FBO holders of USDC, primarily with banks designated by the Financial Stability Board as global systemically important banks (&#147;GSIBs&#148;), which are subject to the highest capital and liquidity requirements and the greatest level of
regulatory supervision in the world. A small fraction of USDC reserves is held as cash within several additional banks, which facilitate the flow of funds from reserves to Circle Mint customers. Currently, all EURC reserves are held only in cash.

provided full transparency into assets comprising Circle stablecoin reserves, first on a monthly basis (on our website), then on a weekly basis (also on our website), and now, in the case of the Circle Reserve Fund, on a daily basis (on
BlackRock&#146;s website). Furthermore, since USDC&#146;s launch, we have provided the public with independent, third-party monthly assurance over the value and composition of these assets from a leading public accounting firm (currently, a Big Four

and unrealized (gains) losses, net, on digital assets held for investment and other related investments; realized (gains) losses on available-for-sale debt securities; impairment losses on strategic investments; merger termination expenses;
restructuring expenses; acquisition-related costs; change in fair value of convertible debt, warrant liability, and embedded derivatives; (gains) losses on sale of long-lived assets; and foreign currency exchange loss. For additional information
regarding our use and the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA, see &#147;Management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations&#151;Non-GAAP financial measures.&#148; The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to

condition, and prospects would likely suffer. In such case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. </I></P>

increasing competition. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We operate in a rapidly changing and highly competitive industry, and our results of operations and future prospects depend in part
on the continued growth of the Circle stablecoin network, our ability to monetize the Circle stablecoin network, and our ability to innovate and create successful new products and services and improve existing products and services. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Although there may be certain regulatory and other barriers to enter the markets we serve, we nonetheless expect our competition to continue to increase. We face
competition from both established enterprises and early-stage companies that are attempting to capitalize on the same, or similar, opportunities as we are. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, particularly
with respect to digital financial services products, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources, and larger customer bases than we do. This may allow them to offer more competitive pricing or other terms or features,
a broader range of digital financial products, or a more specialized set of specific products or services, as well as respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in end-user and customer preferences. Additionally,
when new competitors seek to enter our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share or revenues, they may offer terms, including fee structures, that are more favorable than ours, which could result in a decrease
of our market share or revenues or lead us to adopt less profitable business practices, or otherwise exert downward pressure on our results of operations. For example, actions and policies of our distributors, over which we do not control or
oversee, could negatively impact our results of operations. In any case, with increased competition, we may be required to incur additional costs or expenses relative to our revenue to maintain or grow the Circle stablecoin network and the market
acceptance of our products and services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Our current or future competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that
achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services, which could attract end-users and customers away from our products and services. For example, we are seeing a rapidly evolving market structure in digital asset trading markets, and
certain major trading firms are moving towards TMMFs as a form of collateral. Particularly in the current high interest rate environment, the option to invest in TMMFs or other yield-bearing digital assets has become increasingly attractive relative
to holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, especially for those planning to hold these assets for an extended period of time. Therefore, as TMMFs become more readily accessible and widely integrated on blockchains as a form of collateral in margin
trading, we expect to continue to see a shift toward the use of TMMFs or other yield-bearing digital assets, which could adversely affect the competitiveness and usage of USDC and EURC in this type of use case. Additionally, when new competitors
seek to enter our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, these competitors sometimes undercut, or otherwise exert pressure on, the pricing terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our
market share and/or ability to capitalize on new market opportunities. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Competition from new and existing issuers offering competing products, combined with the rise of yield-bearing
digital assets, including TMMFs, that are attractive to digital asset trading participants, may reduce market demand and circulation of Circle stablecoins. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">With significant growth in the stablecoin market and an increasing understanding that it represents one of the largest potential new markets for financial and payments
infrastructures, we expect to continue to see intense competition. In addition, the emergence of yield-bearing digital assets represents an additional source of competition, particularly in light of the current high interest rate environment, which
has amplified the opportunity cost of holding stablecoins relative to other yield-bearing digital assets. See &#147;Business&#151;Competitive landscape&#148; for a discussion of the competition within the digital asset industry (including from other
stablecoins and yield-bearing digital assets). Stablecoins and other digital assets that are currently issued or may in the future be issued by digital asset trading platforms, major existing global payments companies, major asset management firms,
and banks&#151;along with decentralized algorithmic tokens&#151;are likely to increase competitive pressure on Circle stablecoins and could slow our growth or cause significant declines in our market position. Given the inherent network effects that
accompany stablecoin usage, a rapidly growing competitor, or a well-established payments company, asset management company, or bank that enters the market, could gain enough market share to ultimately limit the viability of Circle stablecoins. As an
example of such an adverse impact, the amount of USDT in circulation (the largest stablecoin by stablecoins in circulation, issued by Tether) increased while the amount of USDC in circulation declined for nearly a one year period from late 2022 to
late 2023, which we believe reflects the different use cases and underlying competitive dynamics for the two stablecoins. New categories of products that provide novel and attractive features, such as yield-bearing digital assets (including TMMFs),
could also gain market acceptance at any time, which may compete with Circle stablecoins and cannibalize our market share, particularly if we fail to anticipate such market shifts or are slow to enter into these nascent markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In addition, we intend to issue TMMFs, including USYC, through our acquisition of Hashnote. The issuance of TMMFs represents a new facet of our business, and there is no
guarantee that we will be successful. USYC may not gain traction relative to existing TMMFs and new TMMFs that compete with USYC may enter the market at any time. In addition, the success of USYC may adversely affect the competitiveness of USDC and
EURC as margin collateral, as trading participants naturally gravitate towards yield-bearing digital assets in this particular type of use case. Our entry into this market may also impact our marketing strategy, and we may not be able to anticipate
how our customers, shareholders, and the market will perceive and respond to any such shift. The pursuit of new product offerings may also divert management&#146;s attention and redirect the flow of resources away from USDC and EURC. The risks
associated with issuing a TMMF in general, and the specific risks of incorporating them into our existing business model, could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business plans and achieve our strategic objectives. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Stablecoins may face periods of uncertainty, loss of trust, or systemic shocks resulting in the potential for rapid redemption requests (or runs). Extreme
scenarios, such as market shocks that affect the value of USDC reserves or simultaneous requests to redeem all or substantially all USDC in circulation, or concerns related to Circle stablecoin reserves, may lead to redemption delays and USDC
reserves being insufficient to meet all redemption requests. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Privately issued stablecoins may be subject to the risk of significant and concentrated
redemption requests, even when they are fully reserved with high quality liquid assets such as cash and short-dated U.S. government obligations. If we experience significant and concentrated redemption requests with respect to one or more Circle
stablecoins, we may need to liquidate a significant portion of Circle stablecoin reserve assets to meet such requests. In extreme cases, the market for the short-dated U.S. government obligations held by the Circle Reserve Fund might not be
sufficiently liquid for BlackRock to liquidate them in a way that allows us to meet redemption demands in a timely manner, which could potentially lead to redemption delays. In the most extreme cases, such as a request to immediately redeem all or
substantially all of the USDC in circulation, the </P>

market for short-dated U.S. government obligations could experience price instability and the USDC reserve may not be sufficient to cover all such redemption requests. When reserve assets and
proceeds from reserve assets are not sufficient to cover all redemption requests, we would be required under the laws governing our licenses and registrations as well as under the Circle Mint user agreement (which provides for the redemption of
Circle stablecoins on a one-to-one basis for Circle Mint customers) to use our own capital to make up any shortfall. See &#147;Business&#151;Regulatory policy landscape.&#148; Our reserve management standard, which, in compliance with applicable
laws and regulatory guidance, limits reserve assets to highly liquid financial instruments, is designed to materially mitigate these risks. See &#147;Business&#151;Reserve management standard&#148; and &#147;Business&#151;Regulatory policy
landscape.&#148; However, our reserve and other policies cannot deter, prevent, or fully protect against significant redemption demand or the ability for the Circle Reserve Fund to meet our redemption requests and banks to meet our withdrawal
requests for demand deposits. Currently, all EURC reserve assets are held only in cash. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Market participants have increasingly shown concern about the sufficiency
and liquidity of reserves for dollar-denominated stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, including due to issues in the traditional financial markets. For example, in March 2023, we announced that we had initiated transfers of the more than
$3&nbsp;billion of deposits from Silicon Valley Bank (&#147;SVB&#148;) to other banks, but those transfers failed to settle before the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;) placed the bank into receivership. Although all of
these funds were ultimately made available and transferred to new banks, concerns related to Circle&#146;s access to these funds caused USDC to experience a temporary price dislocation on certain secondary trading markets during the period when
banks were closed and until the resulting backlog of redemption requests had been cleared, and the amount of USDC in circulation decreased thereafter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In addition,
given the foundational role that stablecoins play in global digital asset markets, stablecoin growth has been tied closely to growth in digital asset markets. As a result, systemic risks that manifest themselves in the digital asset markets may lead
to higher-than-normal redemption requests on Circle stablecoins, which could lead to significant and concentrated redemption requests with respect to one or more Circle stablecoins. The collapse of TerraUSD and LUNA in May 2022 underscored the risks
associated with algorithmic tokens, which are continuing to play out as trading firms and retail and institutional lenders are facing liquidation and insolvency in the aftermath, as reflected in the Voyager Digital Ltd. and Celsius Network LLC
insolvency proceedings, among others. Additionally, the collapse and subsequent insolvency proceedings of FTX also expose the contagion risks related to the broader digital asset market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">These market events have brought significantly more attention to some of the risks with digital assets, and we believe have contributed, in part, to outflows from USDC
at such times. We believe these events in the traditional financial markets and digital asset markets have underscored the importance of robust transparency, audits, and having regulated stablecoins as building blocks for trust and the functioning
of a well-regulated, orderly market for digital assets. While the digital asset market has shown signs of recovery, the full extent of these events may not yet be known. Impacts include, but are not limited to, the consequent and ongoing financial
distress and bankruptcy of certain digital asset market participants, loss of confidence in the broader digital asset market, reputational harm to digital asset market participants, increased negative publicity of the broader digital asset market,
heightened scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers, and calls for increased regulation of digital assets and digital asset market participants. Except as described elsewhere in this prospectus (see &#147;Management&#146;s discussion and analysis of
results of operations and financial condition&#151;Key factors affecting operating results&#151;Exogenous events and macro trends&#148;), we have had no material direct impact to our business, financial condition, customers, or counterparties from
these events; however, these events caused changes to the digital asset market as described above, which indirectly impacted our business and our revenue potential. We do not have any known material financial exposure to any digital asset market

stablecoins are particularly susceptible to operational challenges and risks, including due to surges in demand. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The relative novelty of stablecoins may
pose operational challenges and risks. In particular, some blockchains that support stablecoins have limited operating histories, have not been validated in production, have vulnerabilities that could be abused by malicious users, and are still in
the process of developing and making significant decisions that will affect their respective underlying blockchains. Those features could lead to novel operational risks related to the settlement and validation of transactions, which could result in
fraudulent misuse of such blockchains involving Circle stablecoins or otherwise adversely affect the stablecoins whose protocols are built on top of such blockchains. Failures in one or more public blockchains could result in sustained periods where
end-users cannot access or transfer their Circle stablecoins, which could result in Circle stablecoins losing their reputation as a safe and reliable payment technology. Furthermore, we have in the past experienced and may in the future encounter
periods of extreme and persistent minting activities, which may result in operational delays in accepting fiat currencies, including due to capacity constraints or otherwise, at the banking institutions where our reserves are currently held. Such
delays in processing users&#146; minting requests could negatively impact our ability to attract market entrants and may cause demand to shift toward our competitors. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:8pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Moreover, the governance of many decentralized blockchain networks is by voluntary consensus and open competition, and many developers are not directly compensated for
their contributions. As a result, there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on the governance of any particular blockchain network, a lack of incentives for developers to maintain or develop the network, and other unforeseen issues, any of which
could result in unexpected or undesirable errors, bugs, or changes, or otherwise stymie such network&#146;s utility and ability to respond to challenges and grow. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Any negative publicity regarding stablecoins or the broader digital asset industry may have an outsized negative effect on consumer confidence. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As is the case with other novel technology, compared to more established and well-known industries, any negative publicity regarding blockchain technology and digital
assets companies could have an outsized negative effect on confidence in blockchain technology in general and Circle stablecoins in particular. For example, since the inception of blockchain technology, there have been incidents of smart contract
developers acting maliciously and misappropriating funds, and numerous digital asset businesses and platforms have been sued, investigated, or shut down due to fraud, illegal activities, the sale or issuance of unregistered securities, manipulative
practices, business failure, and cyberattacks or security breaches. In addition, the energy usage and environmental impact of certain blockchains have attracted considerable attention, which could potentially create a negative consumer sentiment and
perception of digital assets and delay a wider acceptance and use of Circle stablecoins, whether or not Circle stablecoins are available on those blockchains. </P>

developments regarding, or the actual or perceived instability of, USDT could cause a loss of trust in other stablecoins, including Circle stablecoins, adversely affect the stablecoin industry and the digital assets ecosystem as a whole, and result
in dramatic market volatility for stablecoins specifically and digital assets generally. A temporary price dislocation in the secondary markets or an outright run on USDT could lead to sustained redemption demand for, a run on, or a similar price
dislocation of Circle stablecoins in the secondary markets. Conversely, significant outflows from USDT could also result in significant inflows into USDC, which could outpace our ability to mint sufficient USDC to meet such demand. Although we have
never experienced any inability to accommodate customer minting or redemption requests when other stablecoins experienced such price dislocation, it is possible that the volatility of inflows and outflows and the demand for minting or redemptions
could be so strong that we may encounter operational difficulties in meeting such demand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>The launch of central bank digital currencies (&#147;CBDCs&#148;)
may adversely impact our business. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The introduction of a government-issued digital currency could eliminate or reduce the need or demand for private-sector
issued stablecoins, or significantly limit their utility. National governments around the world could introduce CBDCs, which could in turn limit the size of the market opportunity for USDC, EURC, and other potential future Circle stablecoins. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Absent federal regulations, there is a possibility that Circle stablecoins may be classified as &#147;securities.&#148; Any classification of Circle stablecoins as
a &#147;security&#148; would subject us to additional regulation and could materially impact the operation of our business. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We believe that Circle
stablecoins are not securities and that the transactions in which we sell them are not securities transactions under U.S. law. Neither the SEC nor any other U.S. federal or state regulator has challenged our assessment, but they have also not
publicly stated whether they agree with our assessment. Despite the Trump Administration&#146;s Executive Order titled &#147;Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology&#148; which includes as an objective, &#147;promoting the
growth of &#145;lawful and legitimate&#146; U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins,&#148; Circle stablecoins have not yet been classified with respect to U.S. federal securities laws. Therefore, while (for the reasons discussed below) we have concluded that
USDC is not a &#147;security&#148; within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws, and registration (or an exemption from registration) of offers or sales of Circle stablecoins is therefore not required under the applicable securities laws,
we acknowledge that a regulatory body or federal court may determine otherwise. Our conclusion, even if reasonable under the circumstances, would not preclude legal or regulatory action based on such a finding that USDC is a &#147;security.&#148;

stablecoins. We have also adapted our process for analyzing the U.S. federal securities law status of Circle stablecoins over time, as guidance and case law have evolved. As part of our U.S.
federal securities law analytical process, we take into account a number of factors, including the various definitions of &#147;security&#148; under U.S. federal securities laws and federal court decisions interpreting the elements of these
definitions, such as the U.S. Supreme Court&#146;s decisions in the <I>Howey</I> and <I>Reves</I> cases, as well as court rulings, reports, orders, press releases, public statements, and speeches by the SEC Commissioners and SEC Staff providing
guidance on when a digital asset or a transaction to which a digital asset may relate may be a security for purposes of U.S. federal securities laws. Our position that neither USDC nor EURC is a &#147;security&#148; is premised, among other reasons,
on our conclusion that neither USDC nor EURC meets the elements of the <I>Howey</I> test. Among the reasons for our conclusion that neither USDC nor EURC is a security is that holders of USDC and EURC do not have a reasonable expectation of profits
from our efforts in respect of their holding of USDC and EURC. Circle stablecoin ownership does not convey the right to receive any interest, rewards, or other returns in respect of their holding of Circle stablecoins. In addition, reserves backing
Circle stablecoins are used only for redemption of Circle stablecoins and not to fund our (or any other entity&#146;s) operating expenses, product development, or any other business purpose. Furthermore, we market Circle stablecoins to the public
only for consumptive purposes, as a payment stablecoin providing a stable, fast, reliable, and accessible means of payment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We acknowledge, however, that the SEC, a
federal court or another relevant entity could take a different view. The regulatory treatment of stablecoins such as USDC has drawn significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies around the world, including from a variety of U.S.
congressional committees and financial regulators. Moreover, there is currently no generally accepted definition of stablecoin; the term &#147;stablecoin&#148; may refer to digital assets that have materially different characteristics from one
another, and different types of stablecoins may be subject to different regulations and requirements. Application of securities laws to the specific facts and circumstances of digital assets is complex and subject to change. Our conclusion, even if
reasonable under the circumstances, would not preclude legal or regulatory action based on a finding that USDC is a &#147;security.&#148; As such, we are at risk of enforcement proceedings against us, which could result in potential injunctions, <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cease-and-desist</FONT></FONT> orders, fines, and penalties if any Circle stablecoins were determined to be a security by a regulatory body or a court. USDC and EURC customers that
purchased directly from Circle would have the right within the applicable <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-year</FONT> statute of limitations to rescind their purchase and receive a full refund of the purchase price with interest thereon to the
extent registration was required but not undertaken. In addition, any enforcement action brought by the SEC against us asserting that USDC, EURC, or any other Circle stablecoin is a security&#151;or any other action against us by any other
regulator&#151;could subject us to private litigation asserting violations of relevant laws. Such developments could impact the adoption of Circle stablecoins, subject us to fines, penalties, and other damages, and adversely affect our business,
results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Recent court cases support our analysis that Circle stablecoins are not securities. For example, in June
2024, a federal district court granted in part Binance&#146;s motion to dismiss against the SEC. The court found that Binance&#146;s stablecoin BUSD was not credibly alleged to be offered or sold in a securities transaction and found implausible the
SEC&#146;s allegation that Binance&#146;s promises to develop the BUSD &#147;ecosystem&#148; would lead purchasers to expect an increase in value &#147;when the alleged defining feature of the &#145;stablecoin&#146; was that its value would remain
constant.&#148; In July 2024, the SEC ended its investigation into the Paxos Trust Company as the issuer of the BUSD stablecoin, stating that it will not recommend enforcement action against Paxos in the investigation of BUSD, which market
participants have interpreted as a conclusion that such stablecoin is not a security. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Notwithstanding these positive indications, if one or more Circle stablecoins
were classified as &#147;securities,&#148; we and other market participants engaging with Circle stablecoins would be subject to significant additional regulation, much of which is incompatible with our and their current practices. Among other
things, this would require us to register the offer and sale of Circle stablecoins under the Securities Act (absent an available exemption) and could obligate us to register as a broker-dealer or in other categories with respect to our role in

could be achieved in full compliance with all relevant regulations. We would not be able to sell Circle stablecoins through an intermediary until a registered broker-dealer (whether an affiliate of ours or a third party) was able to facilitate these
transactions in a compliant manner. Once registered, a new broker-dealer would be subject to, among other things, prescribed regulations governing advertising, KYC, financial responsibility, and customer protection (i.e., custody and safeguarding of
customer assets) and it will be subject to periodic examination by the SEC and FINRA to assess its operations and the adequacy of its regulatory compliance. Further, compliant secondary market trading of digital asset securities under existing laws,
regulations, and guidance may be impractical, greatly impacting the ability of holders of Circle stablecoins to buy and sell their stablecoins, as broker-dealers and other market intermediaries likely would be unwilling to effect such purchases and

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As of December 31, 2024, Circle held approximately 85% of USDC reserves in the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under the 1940
Act managed by BlackRock, one of the world&#146;s largest asset managers, and available only to Circle. The assets within the Circle Reserve Fund are held in the custody of BNY, one of the largest asset custodians in the world. See
&#147;Management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations&#151;Liquidity and capital resources&#151;Composition of USDC reserves&#148; for additional information regarding the Circle Reserve Fund. The Circle
Reserve Fund&#146;s investments and business operations are managed by BlackRock Advisors, LLC, as investment manager, subject to oversight of BlackRock Funds&#146; board of trustees. If the terms of the Circle Reserve Fund are modified in a way
that no longer suits our objectives, or if BlackRock manages the Circle Reserve Fund in a manner inconsistent with our reserve management standard (see &#147;Business&#151;Reserve management standard&#148;), we may redeem our shares of the Circle
Reserve Fund and replace the services provided by BlackRock with other investment managers, which might lead to additional transaction costs; we do not have other recourse (other than under the securities laws if BlackRock manages the Circle Reserve
Fund in a manner inconsistent with the fund&#146;s prospectus). If the Circle Reserve Fund is no longer available to us, we must identify other methods to manage a substantial amount of USDC reserves, such as by identifying additional appropriate
government money market funds and establishing additional relationships with financial institutions and similar firms, which we may not be able to do in a timely manner. In addition, we believe that USDC holders&#146; trust in USDC and USDC reserves
is, in part, based on their perceptions of the issuer, asset manager, and the custodian of the Circle Reserve Fund. As a result, if either BlackRock or BNY suffers significant negative publicity or damage to its reputation or if we choose to partner
with other asset managers or custodians that are not viewed as having equivalent expertise or reputation, trust in USDC could be negatively affected, which could result in an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial

instance, we are required to safeguard customers&#146; assets using security controls that meet our regulatory obligations and also address the specific risks applicable to our hot and cold wallet storage systems as well as our financial management
systems related to such custodial functions. We appropriately ledger, properly segregate, and maintain separate accounts for our corporate-held stablecoins and the reserve assets in respect of our customers&#146; stablecoins. Our security technology
is designed to prevent, detect, and mitigate inappropriate access to our systems, by internal or external threats. We believe we have developed and maintained administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to comply with applicable
legal requirements and industry standards. However, it is nevertheless possible that hackers, employees, or service providers acting contrary to our policies could circumvent these safeguards to improperly access our systems or documents, or the
systems or documents of our third-party service providers or agents, and improperly access, obtain, or misuse customer digital assets and funds. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems are
also constantly changing and evolving, and they may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have obtained insurance coverage for such impropriety in amounts that we believe are appropriate for our business under our primary
financial institution bond insurance (which, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, covers, among other things, theft by employees, unexplainable disappearance of electronic data processing media on our premises, and computer fraud and funds
transfer fraud) and under our vault risk insurance (which, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, covers, among other things, dishonest and/or fraudulent acts and omissions of certain employees in finance, engineering, and custody operations
roles with respect of private keys and/or authentication credentials). However, our insurance may not cover the extent of loss nor the nature of such loss, in which case we may be liable for the full amount of losses suffered, which could be greater
than all of our assets. Our ability to maintain insurance is also subject to the insurance carriers&#146; ongoing underwriting criteria. Our insurance policies described above generally have one-year terms without automatic renewals. As a result, we
must renew such policies annually or enter into new policies, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, particularly as the digital assets insurance market is limited. In addition, any insurance that we maintain may
be insufficient to protect us or our customers against all possible losses or source of losses, and such uninsured losses may exceed our remaining assets, which could cause a substantial business disruption, adverse reputational impact, inability to
compete with our competitors, and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or actions. Additionally, transactions undertaken through our websites or other electronic channels may create risks of fraud, hacking, unauthorized access or acquisition, and
other deceptive practices. Any security incident resulting in a compromise of customer assets could result in substantial costs to us and require us to notify impacted customers and regulators of a possible or actual incident. Such incident may also
expose us to regulatory enforcement actions (including substantial fines), limit our ability to provide services, subject us to litigation, impose significant financial losses, and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial
condition, and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In addition, although we hold at least an equivalent amount of fiat currency denominated assets for stablecoins in circulation, there is

approximately 85% of USDC reserves in the Circle Reserve Fund, which is managed by BlackRock and custodied at BNY, with the remaining portion of USDC reserves held as cash at various banks in accounts that are titled FBO holders of USDC, primarily
GSIBs. These banks may impose requirements or demand information from us regarding us, our customers, or our operations as a condition to our continued relationship, and such requirements or requests may become increasingly rigorous in the future as
our business grows, which could be exacerbated by scrutiny over our industry. Complying with such requirements or requests may be costly and time-consuming and may divert management&#146;s attention from other aspects of our business. If we are
unable to fulfill such requirements or requests on a timely basis, or at all, we may be unable to maintain our existing banking relationships or establish new ones. Furthermore, given our business and industry is under heavy scrutiny from regulators
and policymakers, we may face increased difficulty maintaining existing relationships or entering into new relationships with financial institutions. For example, the U.S. federal banking agencies have increased pressure on banks&#146; relationships
with digital asset firms by, among other things, stating that deposits that represent reserves for stablecoins are subject to heightened liquidity and risk management risks. As our industry develops and becomes subject to increasing scrutiny, this
risk may increase as well. If we are unable to maintain existing relationships with such financial institutions, we may not be able to enter into new relationships with other qualified financial institutions in a timely manner, which may materially
and adversely affect our ability to access reserves, honor redemptions, and offer other services to our customers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In addition, in order to offer our payments,

parties in the Circle stablecoin ecosystem. Specifically, our offering of the payments, payout, and wallet services depends on our ability to offer card transaction processing, ACH transaction processing, and wire transfer processing services to our
customers. In order to provide such transaction processing services, we have established relationships with financial institutions whereby such institutions sponsor us into the relevant payment networks (e.g., the card networks and the ACH). Our
ability to offer these services depends on our ability to maintain existing sponsorship relationships and to establish new sponsorship relationships. Our regulatory status, recent statements by the U.S. federal banking agencies, and the status of
Circle stablecoins and digital assets more generally may be an impediment to our ability to receive or obtain sponsorships from financial institutions, such as Mastercard and Visa. As our industry develops and becomes subject to increasing scrutiny,
this risk may increase as well. Should our sponsorship partners cease providing such sponsorship, we would be at risk of being unable to provide the payment processing services that are core to our customer offering. </P>

soundness, or perceived soundness, of other financial institutions, especially banks holding reserves of Circle stablecoins. This is particularly the case in relation to receivables regarding settled payment transactions, and with respect to cash
and cash equivalents held at financial institutions. We regularly maintain cash balances at banks in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. For example, we had material funds that we attempted to transfer out of SVB before it was placed into FDIC
receivership. The failure of such a bank could result in our inability or delays or disruptions in our ability to access reserves and honor redemptions. Further, Circle stablecoin reserves held in omnibus structures at third-party financial
institutions are not covered by FDIC insurance above applicable limits and are subject to risk of loss. One institution defaulting, failing a stress test, or requiring <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bail-in</FONT> by its shareholders and/or
creditors and/or bail-out by a government could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as was seen during turmoil in the global banking system in 2023. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or
questions about, a counterparty or major financial institution may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by financial institutions to which we have an exposure. This risk resulting from the interdependence on financial
institutions is sometimes referred to as &#147;systemic risk&#148; and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as industry payment systems and banks, with whom we interact on a daily basis. Systemic risk, particularly within the United
States, could expose us to risk of loss, litigation, and potential liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise new funding and on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. </P>

the level of attrition in the future and our revenues could decline as a result of higher-than-expected attrition. In addition, as our large customers typically have arrangements with multiple payment and asset storage services (primarily in order

illicitly acquires access information to a digital wallet. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting, account takeover, and fraud. It is possible that incidents of fraud could
increase in the future. The use of our products or services for illegal or improper purposes could subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, prosecutions, enforcement actions,

program that focuses on enterprise-wide risks related to service providers in terms of misconduct, compliance, and reputational risks. In addition, our internal audit program provides independent review and control testing specific to our business
that work to ensure that risk management, oversight, governance, and internal controls are operating effectively. These programs enable us to identify risks and test associated controls to prevent and detect employee and service provider misconduct.
We employ various manual and automated ways to detect potential employee or third-party misconduct. Examples of these programs are a whistleblower policy and security controls that monitor suspicious activity. For our service providers, our risk
management framework requires us to perform risk-based due diligence on service providers, such as AML screening. We also require annual AML and security training for all employees to help our employees identify and detect misconduct proactively.

intentionally or inadvertently violating the laws in any jurisdiction, we may be subject to governmental inquiries or enforcement actions, prosecuted, or otherwise held secondarily liable for aiding or facilitating such activities. Changes in law
have also increased the penalties for money transmitters, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-money</FONT> issuers, broker-dealers, and alternative trading systems for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider increased or
additional penalties from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against us for involvement in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting

types of digital assets have characteristics such as the speed with which transactions can be conducted, the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple
jurisdictions, the irreversible nature of certain transactions, and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions, which may make digital assets susceptible to use in illegal activity. Federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities
and law enforcement agencies&#151;such as the Department of Justice, the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#147;CFTC&#148;), the Federal Trade Commission (&#147;FTC&#148;), the IRS, and various state securities and financial

require issuers exceeding $10 billion in outstanding issuance to transition to federal oversight. To comply with such legislation, we would have to apply for an OCC non-insured depository
institution charter or acquire an existing one, or be acquired by a bank, and there is a risk that we would not receive approval, in which case we would not be able to continue issuing Circle stablecoins in the United States. We are in the process
of engaging with the applicable state and federal prudential regulators to ensure that Circle would be able to obtain the requisite charter, in the event that any of these legislative proposals are enacted into law. If we were approved, we would
become subject to extensive additional and ongoing regulatory and supervisory requirements that could have a material impact on both our current business and future business activities, and may limit our growth opportunities or require us to divest

equivalent amount of desired applicable Circle stablecoin to a Circle bank account. Once the credit is made to the Circle bank account, tokens are minted to the customer&#146;s Circle Mint account, effectively increasing the applicable Circle
stablecoin in circulation. Likewise, customers with a Circle stablecoin in their Circle Mint account can redeem such tokens so that the system cancels the applicable Circle stablecoin tokens and transfers funds in the applicable fiat currency out of
reserve and into a customer&#146;s linked bank account, effectively reducing the applicable Circle stablecoin in circulation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">If a customer incorrectly enters bank
account credentials or other information when depositing and withdrawing funds, there is a risk that a portion or all of the customer&#146;s assets will be permanently and irretrievably lost with no means of recovery. Alternatively, a customer may
transfer Circle stablecoins or other supported assets to an external wallet address that they do not own, control, or hold the private keys to. Such incidents could result in customer disputes, damage to our brand and reputation, legal claims
against us, and financial liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Protection under the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the

the SIPC provides certain protections to investors for cash or securities held in their brokerage accounts in the event of insolvency of a broker-dealer or limited other circumstances. We do not consider USDC to be a &#147;security&#148; under the
U.S. securities laws and do not believe that the SIPC would currently consider USDC to be cash or securities for these purposes. Accordingly, the protections afforded under the SIPA would not currently apply to Circle stablecoins. If an <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-user</FONT> holds Circle stablecoins with a broker-dealer, in the event of such brokerage firm&#146;s liquidation, for example, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-user&#146;s</FONT> unregistered Circle
stablecoins held in the custody of the broker-dealer will be treated as a general claim as opposed to a claim that has priority over other creditors in a liquidation. Holders of Circle stablecoins would thus not be entitled to SIPC coverage for
missing assets of a liquidated broker-dealer. Accordingly, the lack of SIPA protections and SIPC coverage could adversely affect our ability to retain and obtain new customers and end-users and expand our Circle stablecoin operations. </P>

some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted cyberattacks or security breaches, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure. Attacks upon systems across
a variety of industries, including the digital asset industry, are increasing in their frequency, persistence, and sophistication, and, in many cases, are being conducted by sophisticated, well-funded, and organized groups and individuals, including
state actors. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to systems and information (including customers&#146; personal data and digital assets), disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving,
may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. These cyberattacks or security breaches may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers or
partners. Certain types of cyberattacks or security breaches could harm us even if our systems are left undisturbed. For example, cyberattacks or security breaches may be designed to deceive employees and service providers into releasing control of
our systems to a hacker, while others may aim to introduce computer viruses or malware into our systems with a view to stealing confidential or proprietary data. Additionally, certain threats are designed to remain dormant or undetectable until
launched against a target, and we may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures. Even when a cyberattack or security breach is detected, the full extent of the breach may not be determined immediately. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We have sought to develop systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other cyberattacks or security breaches, and respond to
known and potential risks, and we expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections. For example, we have sought to develop a security program and established controls aligned to the cybersecurity framework established
by the National Institute of Standards and Technology; however, there are several areas that continue to be enhanced and are dependent on a robust asset and device inventory and management tool. This inventory and management tool will assist in
enhancing several dependent security areas of focus: robust security operations (which will provide enhanced logging and monitoring), vulnerability management (which will track vulnerabilities to remediate), endpoint/network security (which will
provide the ability to ensure consistent security controls to Circle endpoints and network), data protection (which will provide the ability to determine known data sources for appropriate data protection controls), and access management (which will
provide the ability to have line of sight to all known applications to address IT governance and access control requirements). Despite our efforts, we may not have implemented all systems, security tools, measures, and processes that are consistent
with industry standards and there can be no assurance that the security measures we have developed and implemented, or that we may develop and implement in the future, will provide absolute security or prevent cyberattacks or security breaches. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We may experience breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities.
Unauthorized parties have attempted, and we expect that they will continue to attempt, to gain access to our systems and facilities, as well as those of our customers, partners, and third-party service providers. Such unauthorized parties have used
various means, including hacking, social engineering, phishing, and attempting to fraudulently induce individuals (including employees, service providers, and our customers) into disclosing usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information, which
may in turn be attempted to be used to access our information technology systems and our customers&#146; digital assets. In the past, we have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in which fraudulent actors obtained company-owned funds. Threats

growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted breach notification and other requirements in the event that information subject to such laws is accessed by unauthorized persons
and additional regulations regarding security of such information are possible. We may in the future need to notify governmental authorities and affected individuals with respect to such incidents. For example, laws throughout the United States and
in foreign jurisdictions, including in all 50 U.S. states, the EEA, the UK, and Singapore, may require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach.
Some laws impose specific data breach reporting obligations if special categories of personal information is disclosed as a result of a cyberattack or information security breach. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of
a cyberattack or information security breach would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability. We may also be contractually required to notify customers
or business partners of a cyberattack or security breach. Regardless of our contractual protections, any actual or perceived cyberattack or security breach, or breach of our legal or contractual obligations, could harm our reputation and brand,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">For example, we are currently in a dispute with a financial advisor (Financial Technology Partners, or &#147;FT
Partners&#148;) regarding two engagement letters between the parties originally entered into in 2020, which, among other things, provided FT Partners a fee of 7% of the gross proceeds from certain capital raises. In 2022, our board of directors
adopted resolutions terminating both engagement letters. On May 28, 2024, FT Partners filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in which it asserted, among other things, that the terminations of both engagement letters are
ineffective and demanded, among other relief, fees and interest for our May 2022 capital raise, our October 2022 sale of certain assets of SeedInvest, and our August 2023 Centre Acquisition (as defined below) and related transactions. We believe
that the relevant transactions, in which we received aggregate cash and in-kind proceeds of approximately $476 million, were consummated after we properly and effectively terminated our engagements with FT Partners, and strenuously dispute FT
Partners&#146; demand for any fees allegedly arising under the engagement letters. On June 20, 2024, we removed the lawsuit to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On July 31, 2024, FT Partners filed an amended complaint,
after which it filed a motion to remand the lawsuit back to state court. On November 18, 2024, FT Partners&#146; motion to remand was denied. On January 28, 2025, we filed a motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment, breach of the covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment claims in the lawsuit. On March 24, 2025, the court granted in full our motion to dismiss. The remaining two breach of contract claims, which were not included in our motion to dismiss and assert that
Circle improperly terminated both engagement letters, are still pending. Our answer to the amended complaint is due on April 28, 2025. While we intend to defend ourselves vigorously, there can be no assurance as to the outcome at this stage. If this
dispute is ultimately resolved by the court in a manner adverse to our position, or if we ultimately settle this dispute by mutual agreement, we may be required to make payments to FT Partners in cash or equity or a combination thereof, which
amounts may be substantial. Depending on the resolution of this matter, we may also remain obligated to pay significant fees to FT Partners for future capital raises or company sale transactions, including this offering. </P>

disagree with and challenge regulators&#146; decisions and actions if we believe such decisions and actions are not grounded in law or regulation. Moreover, the laws, rules, and regulations affecting our business&#151;including those pertaining to
stablecoins, digital assets, internet and mobile services, as well as payment and other financial services&#151;are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. The resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. For the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2024, 2023, and 2022, our reserve income earned from the management of Circle stablecoin-related reserves was $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion, and $735.9&nbsp;million, respectively, which represented 99.1%, 98.6%, and 95.3% of our total revenue from
continuing operations. Fluctuations in interest rates impact reserve return rates, such that a decrease in interest rates reduces reserve return rates and an increase in interest rates increases reserve return rates. Reserve return rate is a
contributing factor to reserve income (the other being, primarily, USDC in circulation), which in turn is a contributor to distribution and transaction costs (the others being, primarily, the amount of USDC held on and off our and Coinbase&#146;s
platforms). As such, fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in reserve income and in turn distribution costs. However, interest rates are only one contributor to reserve income, and the other primary contributor&#151;USDC in
circulation&#151;is inherently difficult to predict given the uncertainties in end-user and customer behavior. For example, although interest rates are positively correlated with the opportunity cost of holding USDC versus other financial
instruments, given the utility of USDC as a means for the exchange of value, an increase in interest rates does not necessarily result in a decrease in USDC in circulation (and vice versa). Any relationship between interest rates and USDC in
circulation is complex, highly uncertain, and unproven. As a result, while we are able to predict the impact of interest rate changes on the reserve return rate, given the uncertainties in customer behavior and interests and market dynamics, we are
unable to accurately predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely

dollars and are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro could affect our revenue and operating results reflected in our U.S. dollar-denominated
financial statements. We do not currently engage in hedging transactions to limit our exchange rate risk, and there can be no assurance that we will do so or do so successfully in the future. </P>

comprehensive tax information reporting rules that apply to persons, including digital asset trading platforms and custodians, that regularly effect transfers of digital assets on behalf of other persons. In particular, these rules require digital
asset trading platforms and custodians to report certain digital asset transactions (including sales, exchanges, and other transfers) effected on behalf of other persons on an annual return, in a manner similar to the current reporting rules for
brokers that effect stock and other securities transactions on behalf of customers. The IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury subsequently released a series of final regulations to implement certain of these rules. The final regulations&#146;
definition of the term &#147;broker&#148; is broad and, in a number of respects, is unclear in scope, but generally requires certain industry participants to perform information reporting and backup withholding functions. Under the final regulations
and a notice released contemporaneously by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury in July 2024, such reporting of cost basis information and backup withholding generally will apply to custodial brokers and brokers acting as principals in

value, and related revenue. Additionally, on January 21, 2025, the SEC launched a crypto task force dedicated to developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for digital assets. However, it remains unclear how the actions or
recommendations of the task force will influence the financial accounting rules to which we are subject. Uncertainties in or changes to regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the need to change our accounting methods and/or

counterparties that are subject to increased regulatory attention or oversight. As a result, certain of our regulators may seek to intervene and assert their jurisdiction or impose additional scrutiny over such relationships or take other adverse
actions toward us (and we may seek to challenge such actions if we believe such actions are not grounded in law or regulation), which may lead to increased compliance costs and potential adverse regulatory consequences that might delay or compel us

us for 1940 Act purposes. The SEC has requested information from a number of participants in the digital assets ecosystem, including Circle, regarding the potential application of the 1940 Act to their businesses. For example, in an action unrelated
to Circle or any of its subsidiaries, in February 2022, the SEC issued a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cease-and-desist</FONT></FONT> order under the 1940 Act to BlockFi Lending LLC, in which the SEC alleged that
BlockFi was operating as an unregistered investment company because it issued securities and also held more than 40% of its total assets, excluding cash, in investment securities, including the loans of digital assets made by BlockFi to
institutional borrowers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">If we were deemed to be an investment company, Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">3a-2</FONT> under the 1940 Act is a safe harbor that

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">3a-2</FONT> is a safe harbor and we may rely on any exemption or exclusion from investment company status available to us under the 1940 Act at any given time. Furthermore, reliance on Rule <FONT

U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#147;OFAC&#148;), as well as similar requirements in other jurisdictions. We have processes in place reasonably designed
to promote compliance with applicable U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> sanctions requirements. The OFAC regulations and requirements generally restrict dealings by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction with certain countries,

world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In the United States, many of our activities are subject to AML laws and regulations, including the BSA and other similar laws and
regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires money transmitters to develop and implement risk-based AML programs; to report large cash transactions and suspicious activity; and, in some cases, to collect and maintain information about
customers who use their services and maintain other transaction records. Regulators in the United States and globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our
compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor transactions on our system, which would include payments to persons outside the United States. Regulators regularly reexamine the transaction
volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers. Any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. We also could be subject to potentially significant fines,
penalties, inquiries, audits, investigations, enforcement actions, and criminal and civil liability if regulators or third-party auditors identify gaps in our AML program that are not sufficiently remediated, or if our AML program is found to
violate the BSA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no guarantee that regulators and/or law enforcement will view
these measures as compliant with the BSA or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations. If regulators and/or law enforcement find that we have violated the BSA or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations, or we are otherwise the subject of government
investigations for alleged violations of the BSA or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations, such investigations and alleged violations could result in negative consequences for us, including costs related to government investigations, financial
penalties, and harm to our reputation. The impact on us related to these matters could be substantial. Although we have implemented controls and screening tools designed to prevent violative activity, there is no guarantee that we will not

turn would affect our business across multiple jurisdictions and/or across our services and products. Conversely, if regulations diverge worldwide, we may face difficulty adjusting our products, services, and other aspects of our business with the

indebtedness and other obligations which could make it more difficult to meet capital, liquidity, or other regulatory requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In addition, although we are
neither a bank nor a bank holding company under U.S. law or the law of any other jurisdiction, as a global provider of financial services and in light of the changing regulatory environment in various jurisdictions, we could become subject to new
capital requirements introduced or imposed by U.S. federal, state, or international regulators. The changes to applicable current or future capital and liquidity requirements may require us to raise additional regulatory capital or hold additional
reserves. Such additional burdens could arise, for example, because of different interpretations of or methods for calculating risk exposure amounts or liquidity outflows or inflows, because we do not comply with ratios and levels, or because
instruments and collateral requirements that currently qualify as capital or capital risk mitigating techniques no longer do so in the future. If we are unable to raise the requisite regulatory capital, we may be required to reduce the amount of our
risk exposure amount or business levels, restrict certain activities, or engage in the disposition of core and other noncore businesses, which may not occur on a timely basis, if at all, or at prices which would not otherwise be attractive to us.
Furthermore, our inability to raise sufficient regulatory capital could have an adverse effect on the market&#146;s trust in the long-term viability of our products and services, which could, for example, result in customers transferring to our
competitors&#146; platforms for the provision of stablecoins and/or payments infrastructure. As a result of stricter liquidity or reserve requirements, we may be required to optimize our funding composition, which may result in higher funding costs
for us. In addition, our having to maintain buffers of liquid assets may result in lower returns than less liquid assets. </P>

collection and use of consumer data. For example, certain states in the United States have enacted stringent privacy and data protection legislation and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (the &#147;CCPA&#148;), which gives
California residents the right to access and request deletion of their personal data, opt out of the sale of personal data, and receive detailed information about how their personal data is processed, and provides a private right of action for
certain data breaches involving the loss of personal data. The California Privacy Rights Act modified the CCPA by expanding consumers&#146; rights with respect to certain personal data and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and
enforcement efforts. Another example is the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which regulates how businesses collect and share personal information. With bills proposed in many other jurisdictions, it remains quite possible that other states
will enact similar privacy and data protection legislation. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, conflicting requirements, additional restrictions, and potential legal risk. The existence of comprehensive privacy

These regimes impose stringent data protection requirements and may increase both the risk of noncompliance and the costs of providing our products and services in a compliant manner. These regimes grant rights for data subjects in regard to their
personal data (including the right to be &#147;forgotten&#148; and the right to data portability) and enhance preexisting rights (e.g., data subject access requests). A breach of the GDPR or UK GDPR could result in regulatory investigations,
reputational damage, fines and sanctions, orders to cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), and civil claims, including representative actions and other class action-type
litigation. Further, Post-Brexit, the UK GDPR will not automatically incorporate changes made to the GDPR going forward, which creates a risk that the GDPR and the UK GDPR may increasingly diverge from each other, thereby increasing both our
compliance costs and the potential for noncompliance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In addition, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA to a &#147;third
country,&#148; including the United States. The same is true for the UK GDPR. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our

However, this decision will likely face legal challenges and ultimately may be invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union just as the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EU-U.S.</FONT> Privacy Shield Framework was. Additionally, on

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We are also subject to evolving EU privacy laws on cookies and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-marketing.</FONT> In the EU, regulators are increasingly focusing on
compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and EU national laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic
communications sector) may be replaced by an EU regulation known as the ePrivacy Regulation, which may alter rules on tracking technologies, impose burdensome requirements surrounding obtaining consent, and significantly increase fines for
noncompliance. In the EU, informed consent&#151;including a prohibition on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-checked</FONT> consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents for each cookie&#151;is required for the placement of a cookie or
similar technologies on a user&#146;s device and for direct electronic marketing (and under the GDPR and the UK GDPR). Valid consent is tightly defined, including a prohibition on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-checked</FONT> consents for each
type of cookie or similar technology. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, enforcement of the ePrivacy Regulation could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our
marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, negatively impact our efforts to understand customers, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As these and other laws and regulations continue to evolve and be enacted, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations are applied, we may need to modify our
data processing practices, agreements, and policies, which could incur substantial costs. Restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of personal information or additional requirements and liability for security and data integrity
could require us to modify our solutions and features, possibly in a material manner. Such restrictions could also limit our ability to develop new services and features, and could subject us to increased compliance obligations and regulatory
scrutiny. We use a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other measures to protect the data we process, including personal data pertaining to our customers, employees, and business partners. Despite the measures we put in
place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such personal data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Moreover, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy
policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from
claims, proceedings, liability, or adverse publicity. Although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. If our public statements about our use, collection, disclosure, and
other processing of personal information&#151;whether made through our privacy policies, information provided on our website, press statements, or otherwise&#151;are alleged to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, we
may be subject to potential government investigations and enforcement actions, including by the FTC or relevant state attorneys general. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Despite our efforts to
comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, it is possible that our practices or technology could fail, or be alleged to fail to meet applicable requirements. For
instance, the overall regulatory framework governing the application of privacy laws to blockchain technology is still undeveloped and likely to evolve. Data protection authorities may adopt different views than we do with respect to the
classification and protection of data associated with blockchain technology under applicable privacy laws.&nbsp;Despite our efforts to choose vendors that meet applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection,
and information security and that maintain robust security controls, it is possible that a vendor could fail to comply or experience a data breach impacting our data and our business. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or
partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations could damage our reputation or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies as well as private litigation. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Our intellectual property rights are valuable. Any inability to protect and enforce such intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, results
of operations, financial condition, and prospects. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Our business depends in part on our ability to seek, obtain, and maintain intellectual property
protection, including with respect to our proprietary technology and our brand. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, patent, and trade secret laws in the United States and
similar laws in other countries, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, to establish, maintain, and protect our brand and other intellectual
property rights. Our efforts to establish, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Our intellectual property rights, including rights in our proprietary technology and trade secrets, could
be lost through misappropriation or breach of our confidentiality and license agreements. Moreover, any of our intellectual property rights may be circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed, misappropriated, or challenged, which could result in
them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products, services, or technologies that are substantially
similar to ours and that compete with our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be
of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. We may also fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and
if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issued may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As we have grown, we have sought to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights in an increasing number of countries, a process that can be expensive and may not
always be successful. For example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental intellectual property agencies require compliance with a number of procedural requirements to complete the trademark application process and to
maintain issued trademarks. Noncompliance with these procedural requirements or nonpayment could result in abandonment or lapse of a trademark or trademark application, resulting in partial or complete loss of trademark rights in a relevant
jurisdiction. In addition, a failure by us to sufficiently exploit any of our trademarks in any markets could erode our trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Further, intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products and services are available, and the laws of certain countries
do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately against unauthorized third-party copying, infringement, or
use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. We may also agree to license our intellectual property to third parties as part of various agreements. See &#147;Business&#151;Intellectual property.&#148; Those licenses may diminish our
ability to counter-assert our intellectual property rights against certain parties that may bring claims against us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Finally, some of our business and some of our
products rely or may in the future rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. Because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses
and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all. </P>

the payment provisions under the Collaboration Agreement with respect to USDC or other applicable Circle stablecoin (such stablecoin, an &#147;applicable stablecoin&#148;) would violate an applicable law or government order, (ii)&nbsp;an order from
a court of competent jurisdiction prohibits us from continuing to satisfy our payment obligations to Coinbase under the Collaboration Agreement with respect to an applicable stablecoin and, in either case of (i)&nbsp;or (ii), such violation of
applicable law or order cannot be remediated with a mutually agreeable amendment or by the parties restructuring their operations with respect to an applicable stablecoin within a certain period of time (the &#147;restructuring period&#148;), or
(iii)&nbsp;we have not resumed our payment obligations under the Collaboration Agreement with respect to an applicable stablecoin following the restructuring period, upon Coinbase&#146;s written request, we would be required to assign to Coinbase
the trademarks relating to such applicable stablecoin that are subject to the Intellectual Property License Agreement. Upon such assignment, we and Coinbase would enter into a new license agreement (the &#147;Flipped Trademark License
Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Coinbase would grant us a worldwide, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusive,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transferable,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-sublicensable</FONT> (other
than to certain software and service providers) right to use such trademark, in connection with the advertising, promotion, marketing, commercialization, issuance, sale, distribution, development, provision, and receipt of such stablecoin. For its
part, Coinbase would be able to use and license the trademarks of such stablecoin for use by third parties so long as neither Coinbase nor any third party uses the trademarks in a manner that suggests that such party is the issuer of such
stablecoin. If our trademarks are assigned to Coinbase, we will have no control over how such trademarks and trade names may be used by Coinbase and any third-party licensees. Any misuse or inconsistent use of such trademarks and trade names may
cause consumer confusion and jeopardize the value of our brand and products. Furthermore, if we fail to make any royalty payments due to Coinbase under the Flipped Trademark License Agreement, Coinbase may terminate the agreement and/or the licenses
granted therein. As it relates to USDC (or any other stablecoin that we issue under the Collaboration Agreement), failure to be able to use the relevant trademarks could have a significant and detrimental effect on our ability to operate as the
issuer of USDC or other stablecoin. Any forced assignment of or other loss of rights to use our trademarks under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition, and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Our and the Circle stablecoin ecosystem&#146;s partners&#146; products and services, including the blockchains on which the Circle

breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open-source software license, we could face litigation, infringement, or other liability. We may also be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue
providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to reengineer our products or services, to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally
available, in source code form, our proprietary code. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Moreover, the terms of many open-source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. As a
result, there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products and services. From time to time, there have been claims
challenging the ownership of open-source software against companies that incorporate open-source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software.

intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies like ours. We also may be subject to claims of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property. </P>

to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that we, our customers, or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we, our customers, or other parties indemnified by
us may be found to be infringing upon such rights. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the digital asset market grows and matures. Any claims or litigation, regardless of merit, could cause us to incur
significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our products or services or

example, certain index providers restrict inclusion of companies with multiple class share structures in certain of their indexes. In addition, certain proxy advisory firms oppose the use of dual or multiple class structures. As a result, the
multiple series structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in certain indices and may cause proxy advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to
cause us to change our capital structure, which could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock. In addition, the difference in the voting rights of the various
series of our common stock could harm the value of our Class A common stock to the extent that any investor or potential future purchaser of our Class A common stock ascribes value to the superior voting power of our Class B common stock. </P>

technology adoption, digital assets, and payments, as well as our customers. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity declined resulting in lower
consumption rates, restricted credit, reduced profitability, weaknesses in financial markets, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. The impact of general economic conditions on the digital assets ecosystem is highly
uncertain and dependent on a variety of factors, including market adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets, global trends in the blockchain economy, central bank monetary policies, and other events beyond our control. Geopolitical
developments, such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related economic and other retaliatory measures taken by the United States, the European Union, and others, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, trade wars, tariffs imposed by
the new administration, and foreign exchange limitations can also increase the severity and levels of unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial and digital asset markets. Our business, results of operations, financial
condition, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and digital assets market resulting from the conflicts in Ukraine or the Middle East, new trade policies including tariffs, or any other
geopolitical tension or general adverse economic condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>We may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events, as

events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, our global operations
expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. Further, acts of terrorism, labor activism or unrest, and other geopolitical unrest
could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners or the economy as a whole. In the event of a natural disaster, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in
development of our products and services, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We do not maintain insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that could result from disruptions to our products and services.
Additionally, all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or our business partners&#146; disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. To the extent natural disasters or other
catastrophic events concurrently impact data centers we rely on in connection with private key restoration, customers will experience significant delays in withdrawing funds, or in the extreme, we may suffer losses of our customer funds. </P>

identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not achieve our intended outcomes, for example, due to technical difficulties migrating the acquired products
into our ecosystem. Moreover, the companies we acquire may have different risk tolerances than ours, which could result in decisions that do not enhance our competitive position or achieve our strategic goals. Acquisitions may also require
regulatory approvals that are costly or time-consuming to obtain, and any difficulties or delays in complying with such regulatory requirements would hinder our strategic objectives. We may also lose certain pre-existing business relationships as a
result of new acquisitions, given the highly competitive nature of the digital asset industry. Furthermore, any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, shareholders, and the market. We may not be aware of all of the

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; million, or approximately $&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;
million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, at the assumed initial public offering price of $&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of
this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from sales of shares of Class A common stock by the selling stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price would increase or decrease the net proceeds to us by $&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; million,
assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each 1,000,000 share
increase or decrease in the number of shares offered by us would increase or decrease the net proceeds to us by $&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital,
create a public market for our Class A common stock, facilitate our future access to the public equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential customers and end-users, and improve our competitive position. We intend to use the net
proceeds from this offering to satisfy an estimated $&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; of tax withholding and remittance obligations in connection with the IPO RSU Vest and to use the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Founded in 2013, Circle&#146;s mission is to raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of value. We intend to connect the world more deeply by
building a new global economic system on the foundation of the internet, and to facilitate the creation of a world where everyone, everywhere can share value as easily as we can today share information, content, and communications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Since inception, we have relentlessly pursued our mission and vision, building fundamental technology for the internet financial system. We have forged paths toward
mainstream acceptance through persistent and active engagement with policymakers and regulators globally, and have seen institutional and consumer knowledge and acceptance of internet-native financial assets approach critical mass. Large and
influential players in the incumbent financial services system are increasingly embracing digital assets broadly and stablecoins specifically. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Circle&#146;s
innovative products reach tens of millions of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-users,</FONT> power thousands of businesses, and, as of December 31, 2024, USDC has been used for approximately $20.0 trillion in onchain transactions. While we have
made strong progress in our pursuit of our mission and vision over the past decade, we believe the internet financial system is in its infancy with decades of growth and innovation ahead. </P>

payment stablecoin as measured by the amount of stablecoins in circulation. See &#147;Prospectus summary&#151;Overview&#151;Stablecoin overview&#151;Circle&#146;s role in driving stablecoin adoption&#148; for our use of the term
&#147;regulated&#148; with respect to stablecoins and see &#147;Business&#151;Regulatory policy landscape&#148; for the principal regulations to which we are subject. USDC&nbsp;makes the dollar digitally available via the internet, taking advantage
of the internet&#146;s capabilities, transparency, speed, and efficiency. In June 2022, we launched EURC utilizing the same underlying infrastructure. In July 2024, Circle&#146;s French subsidiary became the first global stablecoin issuer to achieve
compliance with MiCAR. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Stablecoins act as the bridge between the fiat and digital assets ecosystems. We believe the ability of Circle Mint customers to quickly and
confidently move from fiat to Circle stablecoins is essential to the growth of the Circle stablecoin network. The volume of USDC minted and redeemed demonstrates the scale and resiliency of the banking infrastructure supporting our <FONT

infrastructure and open-source smart contracts that streamlines the end-user experience by supporting the payment of transaction fees on supported blockchains in USDC, thus removing the need to pay fees in each blockchain&#146;s native token. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">CCTP is a permissionless protocol that enables USDC to flow natively across supported blockchains and provides interoperability to blockchains that have historically

enhance its interoperability across multiple public blockchains and enable instantaneous conversion with Circle stablecoins, allowing traders to hold their assets or pledge collateral in TMMFs while accruing yield and then be able to instantaneously
convert into stablecoins, which can be used to purchase other digital assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The Circle stablecoin network, blockchain infrastructure, Developer Services

and accelerating innovation. While the internet financial system has grown rapidly, it remains in its infancy and is very small relative to the legacy financial system. We believe we are well positioned to be among the winners in this emerging,
transformative space, and we expect increased adoption and expansion of the internet financial system to be a key driver of growth in all our products and services, and hence of our overall financial performance. </P>

of stablecoins in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap. We believe that we are poised to lead the way in driving the growth of stablecoins, with our trusted brand, regulation-first posture, robust scalable infrastructure, institutional-grade
safety and soundness, and $43.9&nbsp;billion of USDC in circulation across 4.3&nbsp;million MeWs as of December 31, 2024. We stand to benefit as the adoption of stablecoins and the internet financial system increase, due not only to the growth in
circulation of Circle stablecoins but also due to the Circle stablecoin network that we have developed. The following chart provides an overview of MeWs at quarter end for the periods presented. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Access to the internet financial system transcends boundaries and borders. The growing international interest in both internet-based financial services broadly&#151;and
the Circle stablecoin network specifically&#151;is a driver of our business. Our efforts to expand awareness and distribution of USDC follow a multi-pronged approach. We intend to continue expanding our global reach by obtaining regulatory licenses
and registrations in additional jurisdictions, collaborating with strategic partners, and expanding our blockchain interoperability. We also intend to continue to invest in expanding awareness and distribution of Circle stablecoins in international
markets, including through initiatives such as sponsored webinars, content sponsorship, event sponsorship, and traditional advertising (e.g., search engine marketing/retargeting), to further enhance our growth. Beyond our dedicated awareness
initiatives, we continue to strive to make the Circle stablecoin network the most widely available and easy to use globally by integrating into many major blockchain protocols, which we believe will enhance both demand and distribution of Circle
stablecoins. We expect increased awareness and interest in Circle stablecoins, including both increasing penetration among our existing markets and expansion into new markets, to positively impact our performance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Strategic partnerships fostering the Circle stablecoin network </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Another core facet of our strategy is to complement our products and services with enterprise-level strategic commercial partnerships, with the goal of driving growth in
the distribution and adoption of Circle stablecoins. Through these partnerships, we enable companies to offer internet-native financial services to their own customers, to the benefit of our overall network. In addition to our international
partnerships with major consumer and technology brands (see &#147;Business&#151;Our platform, products, and ecosystem&#151;The Circle stablecoin ecosystem&#148; for examples of partners that are part of the Circle stablecoin network and the Circle
stablecoin ecosystem), we partnered with Visa to enable the use of USDC within its payments network, and with MoneyGram to support the use of USDC for global remittances on the Stellar blockchain, among others. These partnerships are still in early
stages, but we expect that they will contribute meaningfully to our operating and financial performance over time. We have also partnered with Coinbase to provide seamless access within its platform to convert between fiat currency and USDC and
recently entered into a partnership with Binance to make USDC more extensively available across its full suite of products and services and adopt USDC as a dollar stablecoin for its corporate treasury. We plan to continue to enter strategic
partnerships like these to expand our product offerings and amplify the network effect inherent in our business. We believe each of these partnerships helps to foster broader access to Circle stablecoins and the internet financial system. These
partnerships enable awareness and access of the Circle stablecoin network by new end-users who may otherwise not directly be reached, while benefiting existing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-users</FONT> by expanding the opportunities for
internet-based commerce. We expect these partnerships will drive greater circulation, adoption, and use of Circle stablecoins over time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Growth in new
products and services </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We believe we have a sizable opportunity to grow our business through the introduction of new products and services. Our blockchain
infrastructure and Developer Services provide platforms upon which third-party software developers can build and create their own products and financial applications. For example, we launched our CCTP offering in early 2023 and have already seen its
significant growth: It is live on nine blockchains (Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Noble, OP Mainnet, Polygon PoS, Solana and Sui) enabling 70 routes and, as of December 31, 2024, has handled approximately $24.7 billion in transfers. We
calculate CCTP volume by analyzing data from all blockchains on which CCTP is deployed to match receiving USDC transaction data on destination blockchains with USDC redemption data from source blockchains, and then summing up the USDC redemption
volumes on the source blockchains. In March 2025, we launched CCTP V2, a </P>

fast version of CCTP that monetizes and accrues revenue on each transaction. CCTP V2 is currently available on Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, and Linea, with more blockchains expected to be announced
throughout 2025. We continue to develop our blockchain infrastructure and Developer Services products, facilitating the development of new third-party products for the internet financial system, which we expect will in turn increase demand for
Circle stablecoins and serve as a critical driver to the growth of our network. We anticipate that the products developed on our platform will drive new sources of revenue, including network service fees and additional Developer Services fees. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Interest rate fluctuations </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We derive the majority of our revenue from
reserve income. Fluctuations in interest rates impact reserve return rates, such that a decrease in interest rates reduces reserve return rates and an increase in interest rates increases reserve return rates. Reserve return rate is a contributing
factor to reserve income (the other being, primarily, USDC in circulation). As such, fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in reserve income. However, interest rates are only one contributor to reserve income, and the other primary
contributor&#151;USDC in circulation&#151;is inherently difficult to predict given the uncertainties in end-user and customer behavior. For example, although interest rates are positively correlated with the opportunity cost of holding USDC versus
other financial instruments, given the utility of USDC as a means for the exchange of value, an increase in interest rates does not necessarily result in a decrease in USDC in circulation (and vice versa). Any relationship between interest rates and
USDC in circulation is complex, highly uncertain, and unproven. As a result, while we are able to predict the impact of interest rate changes on the reserve return rate, given uncertainties in end-user and customer behavior and interests and market
dynamics, we are unable to accurately predict the impact of such changes on reserve income. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Exogenous events and macro trends </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In March 2023, SVB failed to honor Circle&#146;s request to withdraw $3.3&nbsp;billion (approximately 8% of the USDC reserves at the time) in reserve deposits, which was
submitted prior to SVB&#146;s failure and subsequent FDIC receivership. The FDIC receivership announcement made abruptly on Friday, March&nbsp;10, 2023 caused some market concern that an inability to instantly access the deposits held at SVB might
result in USDC not being fully backed by fiat-denominated reserves. In response, we publicly affirmed that in the event SVB did not make a full return of our reserve deposits, we would cover any shortfall using corporate resources, aligning with our
commitment to maintaining the trustworthiness, safety, and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-for-one</FONT></FONT> redeemability of USDC by Circle Mint customers. Subsequent secondary market trading of USDC on
certain digital asset exchanges, exacerbated by the lack of primary market liquidity given the weekend closure of the banking system and the concurrent failure of two other banks that were part of the Circle stablecoin ecosystem, which had
previously provided 24/7/365 primary liquidity infrastructure, resulted in a temporary supply-demand imbalance, and consequently the secondary market price of USDC fell below $1. On Monday, March&nbsp;13, 2023, the FDIC formally announced that it
would guarantee all deposits held at SVB, and USDC soon regained its $1 secondary market trading price. When the banking system reopened, we began processing the weekend&#146;s queued redemptions, although due to the backlog and the failure of some
of the banks that were part of the Circle stablecoin ecosystem, redemptions for some customers were slowed. Although we did not incur any direct financial loss in connection with the SVB failure and we honored one-for-one redeemability of USDC by
Circle Mint customers at all times, we believe the SVB failure was a contributing factor to the subsequent decline in USDC in circulation. Since the SVB failure, we have continued to invest in and refine our reserve management structures, including
by strengthening our governance around reserve management (see &#147;Business&#151;Reserve management standard&#148;), improving analysis and monitoring of counterparties (considering factors such as customer concentration, asset liability
management, capital structure, profitability, and externalities), implementing end-of-day sweeps to manage counterparty risk at settlement banks, and holding the significant majority of cash reserves at GSIBs. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">While our view is that in the long-term, USDC in circulation will be driven by secular growth in the adoption of the
internet financial system, as well as our introduction of new products within the Circle stablecoin network, in the short term we believe isolated events or temporary trends can have meaningful impact on USDC minting and redemptions. For example, we
believe that the regional banking crisis in the United States in March 2023&#151;and most notably the SVB failure discussed above&#151;spurred outsized redemptions in the weeks following a brief price dislocation of USDC in certain secondary
markets. Similarly, following the collapse of several digital asset lenders (e.g., Celsius, Voyager) in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-2022,</FONT> we believe the subsequent rapid decline of decentralized finance lending market activity (which
was a notable industry use case for USDC at the time) resulted in significant redemptions due to the reduction in need for USDC deployment to such protocols. Finally, particularly in times of uncertainty for the stablecoin and digital assets
industries, we believe that our uniquely robust connectivity with traditional banks has resulted in USDC serving as an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-ramp</FONT> (i.e., channel into fiat currency) from certain digital asset enterprises that
lack meaningful banking coverage, with the net result being an inflated amount of USDC redemptions. While we believe these events and developments are nonrecurring in nature, they can have an impact on USDC in circulation and our short-term
financial results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Distribution costs </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Our distribution costs
have a meaningful impact on our financial performance. Prior to August 2023, distribution costs were primarily a function of (i)&nbsp;the amount of USDC distributed by Circle and Coinbase and (ii)&nbsp;the amount of USDC held on each respective
party&#146;s platform. Specifically, we shared any revenue generated from USDC reserves pro rata based on the amount of USDC distributed by each respective party and the amount of USDC held on each respective party&#146;s platform in relation to the
total amount of USDC in circulation. See &#147;Business&#151;Collaboration with Coinbase.&#148; In August 2023, we and Coinbase entered into a Collaboration Agreement, under which we make payments to Coinbase for its role in the distribution of USDC
and growth in the USDC ecosystem. These payments are determined based on the daily income generated from the reserves backing USDC, less the management fees charged by non-affiliated third parties for managing such reserves (such as asset management
and custody fees) and certain other expenses, which is referred to as the &#147;payment base.&#148; From this payment base, (i) we retain a portion ranging from an annualized low-double-digit basis point to high tenth of a basis point based on the
amount of USDC in circulation on such day, in consideration of our role as stablecoin issuer and which is designed to reimburse us for indirect costs of issuing stablecoins and the management of the associated reserves, such as maintaining our
accounting, treasury, regulatory, and compliance functions (the &#147;issuer retention&#148;), (ii) we and Coinbase each receive an amount equal to the remaining payment base multiplied by the percentage of such stablecoin that is held in the
applicable party&#146;s custodial products or managed wallet services at the end of such day (after deducting (i) and (ii) above, the &#147;residual payment base&#148;), and (iii)&nbsp;after deducting amounts payable to other approved participants
in the USDC ecosystem, Coinbase receives 50% of the residual payment base. See &#147;Business&#151;Collaboration with Coinbase.&#148; As a result, the greater the proportion of USDC in circulation held on Coinbase&#146;s platform, the greater the
proportion of reserve income payable to Coinbase. Conversely, the greater the proportion of USDC in circulation held on our platform or held outside of Circle and Coinbase platforms, the smaller the proportion of reserve income payable to Coinbase.
As a result, distribution costs are impacted by the actions and policies of Coinbase and their effects on the amount of USDC in circulation held on Coinbase&#146;s platform, which we do not control or oversee. As of December 31, 2024, 2023, and
2022, the percentage of USDC in circulation held on Circle&#146;s platform was approximately 5%, 2%, and 1%, respectively; based on information provided to us by Coinbase, the percentage of USDC in circulation held on Coinbase&#146;s platform was
approximately 20%, 12%, and 5%, respectively; and the percentage of USDC in circulation held outside Circle&#146;s and Coinbase&#146;s platforms was approximately 75%, 86%, and 94%, respectively. </P>

Coinbase may agree to pay a portion of the residual payment base to approved participants to incentivize the circulation of stablecoins, which may impact our distribution costs. We have added and

regulatory clarity will result in increased conviction in stablecoins by consumers and enterprises alike, which will drive comfort in using stablecoins as digital currencies. We believe these trends will naturally increase the growth of the Circle

Circle Reserve Fund, as applicable. Interest income is recognized under the effective interest method, and dividend income is recognized when declared. Reserve income is recorded on a gross basis before the impact of any distribution costs. An
increase in the amount of Circle stablecoins in circulation (i.e., the amount of stablecoins minted is greater than the amount of stablecoins redeemed) would increase the amount of assets held in reserve accounts, and thus, assuming a constant
reserve return rate, would result in increased reserve income. Conversely, a decrease in the amount of Circle stablecoins in circulation (i.e., the amount of stablecoins redeemed is greater than the amount of stablecoins minted) would decrease the
amount of assets held in reserve accounts, and thus, assuming a constant reserve return rate, would result in decreased reserve income. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Other revenue </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Other revenue consists of revenues generated from products that increase the utility of Circle stablecoins and related transactional or wallet infrastructure. The
components of other revenue primarily include revenues from transaction services, integration services, and other revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Distribution, transaction, and

distribution costs to incentivize distributors to use and distribute Circle stablecoins. Prior to August 2023, distribution costs were primarily a function of (i)&nbsp;the amount of USDC distributed by Circle and Coinbase and (ii)&nbsp;the amount of
USDC held on each respective party&#146;s platform. Specifically, we shared any revenue generated from USDC reserves pro rata based on the amount of USDC distributed by each respective party and the amount of USDC held on each respective
party&#146;s platform in relation to the total amount of USDC in circulation. See &#147;Business&#151;Collaboration with Coinbase.&#148; In August 2023, we and Coinbase entered into a Collaboration Agreement, under which we make payments to Coinbase
for its role in the distribution of USDC and growth in the USDC ecosystem. These payments are determined based on the daily income generated from the reserves backing USDC, less the management fees charged by non-affiliated third parties for
managing such reserves (such as asset management and custody fees) and certain other expenses, which is referred to as the &#147;payment base.&#148; From this payment base, (i) we retain a portion ranging from an annualized low-double-digit basis
point to high tenth of a basis point based on the amount of USDC in circulation on such day, in consideration of our role as stablecoin issuer (the &#147;issuer retention&#148;), (ii) we and Coinbase each receive an amount equal to the remaining
payment base multiplied by the percentage of such stablecoin that is held in the applicable party&#146;s custodial products or managed wallet services at the end of such day (after deducting (i) and (ii) above, the &#147;residual payment
base&#148;), and (iii) after deducting amounts payable to other approved participants in the USDC ecosystem, Coinbase receives 50% of the residual payment base. See &#147;Business&#151;Collaboration with Coinbase.&#148; The issuer retention is
designed to reimburse us for indirect costs of issuing stablecoins and the management of the associated reserves, such as maintaining our accounting, treasury, regulatory, and compliance functions, which are generally recognized in various operating
expenses including compensation expenses and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. </P>

These deductions are accounted for as components of the overall arrangement with Coinbase as we are not providing a distinct service to issue stablecoins and manage the associated reserves. The
Collaboration Agreement is accounted for as an executory contract and reflected in distribution and transaction costs in our consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we incurred $907.9
million, $691.3 million, and $248.1 million, respectively, of distribution costs in connection with our agreements with Coinbase. We expect our distribution expense to increase in the future as we add distributors and approved participants. Our
distribution expense will also increase to the extent our reserve income increases over time. We also anticipate new distribution arrangements may differ depending on our negotiations with our distributors and the circumstances in our evolving
industry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We also incur transaction costs to pay for the blockchain network transaction fees necessary to complete transactions on supported blockchains. For a

in the first quarter of 2023, we designated the embedded derivatives associated with the obligation to return digital asset collateral related to stablecoin lending as the hedging instrument in a fair value hedge relationship to hedge the fair value
exposure of the corresponding digital assets. Subsequent to the fair value hedge designation, the digital assets designated as the hedged item along with the embedded derivative are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value of the embedded

$12.0 million decrease in transaction services revenue as our legacy transaction services products have been discontinued, a $7.5 million decrease in treasury services revenue as the Circle Yield product offering has been terminated, and a $2.8
million decrease in other revenue as our SeedInvest crowdfunding services have ceased. This was partially offset by a $6.0 million increase in revenues related to integration services. </P>

distribution costs paid to Coinbase as a combined result of increased reserve income and Coinbase&#146;s increased on-platform balances, along with a $74.1 million increase in other distribution incentive costs related to new strategic distribution
partnerships, including our upfront, one-time fee to Binance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Distribution and transaction costs increased by $432.9 million, or 150.8%, for the year ended

a percentage of reserve income. The increase in the Coinbase distribution cost percentage is primarily driven by a change in the distribution costs payment calculation in August 2023 (when the Company entered into the Collaboration Agreement) to
utilize a fixed percentage of off-platform balances as opposed to a variable calculation of each party&#146;s respective issuance or resale volume, as was the case under the previous agreements governing the operation of the Centre Consortium. This

on digital assets held for investment and other related investments; realized (gains) losses on available-for-sale debt securities; impairment losses on strategic investments; merger termination expenses; restructuring expenses; acquisition-related

historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures or operating histories, review and assess the performance of our management team and other employees, and prepare budgets and evaluate strategic planning

accordance with the terms of its agreement with Circle Mint customers and applicable regulatory requirements and commercial laws. All USDC minted and outstanding are backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollar-denominated assets held in accounts
that are titled FBO holders of USDC, and are held in omnibus structures, agnostic to individual customer and customer jurisdiction. During the periods presented, prior to January 2023, USDC reserves were limited to cash balances held at banks, U.S.
Treasury securities with maturities of 100 days or less, and the Circle Reserve Fund. Since January 2023, USDC reserves have been limited to cash balances held at banks and the Circle Reserve Fund. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As of December&nbsp;31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, USDC reserves held as cash balances at banks (labeled as &#147;Cash&#148; in the table below) significantly exceeded the
FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 per financial institution. As of December&nbsp;31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, FDIC deposit insurance related to financial institutions where USDC reserves were held was limited to an aggregate amount of $1,250,000
(representing five FDIC-insured financial institutions), $750,000 (representing three FDIC-insured financial institutions), and $1,750,000 (representing seven FDIC-insured financial institutions), respectively. The liabilities related to Deposits

reserves are held in the Circle Reserve Fund. The remaining amount is held in cash and distributed across several banks. We allocate USDC reserves across the different types of reserve assets in accordance with our reserve management standard (see
&#147;Business&#151;Reserve management standard&#148;) in a manner designed to ensure available liquidity to meet redemption requests. The portion of USDC reserves that we hold as cash at various banks is informed by our historical experience of the
liquidity required to meet redemption requests and the time required to convert other reserve assets into cash. Any excess cash (i.e., amounts not required to satisfy near-term redemption requests based on our historical experience) is invested in
the Circle Reserve Fund, in an attempt to mitigate the credit and counterparty risk of holding cash at banks in amounts exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. Conversely, if the cash held at any bank is insufficient to satisfy near-term redemption
requests based on our historical experience, we transfer cash from other banks or redeem shares of the Circle Reserve Fund to remedy such shortfall. </P>

assets backing EURC (which is held only in cash at banks and not material for the periods presented) and excludes the amount of reserve assets backing corporate-held USDC. In addition, the amounts differ due to timing and settlement differences,

Reserve Fund acting in ways that are not permitted under the 1940 Act or inconsistent with the disclosure in the fund&#146;s prospectus. In addition, as the shareholder of the Circle Reserve Fund, together with all other shareholders of funds

required to provide financial support for the fund at any time. If the terms of the Circle Reserve Fund are modified to no longer suit our objectives, or if BlackRock manages the Circle Reserve Fund in a manner inconsistent with our reserve
management standard (see &#147;Business&#151;Reserve management standard&#148;), we may redeem our shares of the Circle Reserve Fund; we do not have other recourse (other than under the securities laws if BlackRock manages the Circle Reserve Fund in

prospectus, the board of trustees has chosen not to subject the Circle Reserve Fund to liquidity fees or redemption gates, although the board of trustees may change this policy with advance notice to us. Although there are generally no limitations
(except as described below) on our ability to redeem shares of the Circle Reserve Fund, redemptions of a large number of shares within a short period of time may adversely affect the Circle Reserve Fund&#146;s liquidity and net assets and may force
the Circle Reserve Fund to sell portfolio securities to meet such redemption requests when it might not otherwise do so. As is customary for money market funds, the Circle Reserve Fund may (i) suspend the right of redemption if trading is halted or
restricted by the NYSE or under other emergency conditions described in the 1940 Act; (ii) postpone the date of payment upon redemption if trading is halted or restricted on the NYSE or under other emergency conditions described in the 1940 Act or
if a redemption request is made before the Circle Reserve Fund has collected payment for the purchase of shares; (iii) redeem shares for property other than cash as may be permitted under the 1940 Act; and (iv) redeem shares involuntarily in certain
cases, such as when the value of a shareholder account falls below a specified level. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Our determination of whether to invest and the amount of investment in the

management to make a number of key assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. The expected term represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding and is
estimated using the midpoint between the requisite service period and the contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate is estimated using the rate of return on U.S. Treasury notes with a life that approximates the expected term.
Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the underlying common stock and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. </P>

deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and

We test for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter or more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment. In assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to
determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In the qualitative assessment, we may consider factors such as economic conditions, industry and market conditions and developments, overall financial performance, and
other relevant entity-specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Should we conclude that it is more likely than not that the recorded goodwill and
intangible assets amounts have been impaired, we would perform the impairment test. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying amount of
the reporting unit or intangible asset. Significant judgment is applied when goodwill and intangible assets are assessed for impairment. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets for changes in circumstances

estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and are based on the status of the legal

rates and an increase in interest rates increases reserve return rates. Reserve return rate is a contributing factor to reserve income (the other being, primarily, USDC in circulation), which in turn is a contributor to distribution and transaction
costs (the others being, primarily, the amount of USDC held on and off our and Coinbase&#146;s platforms). As such, fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in reserve income and in turn distribution costs. However, interest rates are
only one contributor to reserve income, and the other&#151;USDC in circulation&#151;is inherently difficult to predict given the uncertainties in end-user and customer behavior. For example, although interest rates are positively correlated with the
opportunity cost of holding USDC versus other financial instruments, given the utility of USDC as a means for the exchange of value, an increase in interest rates does not necessarily result in a decrease in USDC in circulation (and vice versa). Any
relationship between interest rates and USDC in circulation is complex, highly uncertain, and unproven. As a result, while we are able to predict the impact of interest rate changes on the reserve return rate, given the uncertainties in end-user and
customer behavior and interests and market dynamics, we are unable to accurately predict the impact of such changes on reserve income or distribution and transaction costs. </P>

circulation as of December 31, 2024, due to the inherent uncertainties described above in respect of predicting or forecasting USDC in circulation; such changes in interest rates occur on January 1, 2025 and are held constant through the period and
impact all reserve assets equally; and our allocation of reserve assets do not change, as we are unable to predict the market and </P>

advent of blockchain networks, the global financial system can be rebuilt on the principles of the internet&#151;those of open software and public networks&#151;to the benefit of all of society. This new internet financial system has the potential
to address the structural inefficiencies of the legacy financial system, enabling value to be exchanged more quickly, more cheaply, more safely, and in new, innovative ways&#151;thereby increasing both the benefit of and access to the financial
system for all people and all businesses across the globe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Finance is fundamentally built upon the movement of money in the form of the transmission of data,
wrapped in trust, and protected by regulation.</I>&#8195;Finance is built upon the movement of money. In modern digital finance, the movement of money is the movement of data between accounts in private, permissioned databases. This movement of
money is typically tightly controlled and regulated by individual nations to ensure safety and soundness of the financial system and to protect against abuse by bad actors. Although the infrastructure system enabling this movement of money is
critical to the functioning of the existing financial system and powers one of the largest sectors in the global economy, the technology underpinning this system in large part dates from the 1970s and 1980s. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Today</I><I>&#146;</I><I>s financial system has brought countless benefits, yet inefficiencies remain stubbornly high.&#8195;</I>The financial system has enabled
massive societal advances, lifting billions of people out of extreme poverty and contributing to enormous economic growth. Technological advancements have enabled innovations such as credit cards, electronic payments, and electronic capital markets.
Yet despite this history of progress, and despite intense competition, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-user</FONT> costs and systemic inefficiencies persist. Modern FinTech firms have generally focused on modernizing <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">front-end</FONT> interfaces but still often rely on legacy infrastructure, limiting true innovation. We believe the next innovation in the exchange of value, which is our core focus at Circle, will drive an evolution in
the underlying infrastructure of the financial system that meets critical market demand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The internet revolutionized the transmission of data, bringing
exponential growth and previously unimagined innovation to countless sectors. Likewise, the internet has the potential to transform today&#146;s financial system</I>.&#8195;The advent of the internet enabled &#147;all-to-all&#148; communication at
vastly lower costs by advancing communication from tightly controlled analog rails (e.g., radio, telephone, cable) to standardized network protocols. These protocols enabled new infrastructure for the movement of data and information. While adoption
took time, and early use cases initially both struggled to scale and encountered meaningful scrutiny, over time, more innovators and developers began building on the internet and more users connected to the network via the applications they built.
The end result: the cost of communication has approached zero at point of use, the volume of communication has exploded, and previously unimaginable services have now emerged. Today, the leaders of the modern digital economy are built on internet
rails, and more of the economy is transitioning to these rails each day. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Blockchain networks enable the creation of the internet financial
system.&#8195;</I>Blockchains provide a new base layer of internet infrastructure that uses advancements in cryptography and distributed computing to enable secure data exchange, transaction processing, and computation. These advancements make new
categories of applications on the internet possible, including issuing digital financial assets, efficiently exchanging and processing transactions involving these assets, and writing code that can intermediate more complex transactions.
Importantly, these blockchain networks can operate openly on the internet, reducing society&#146;s dependence on centralized intermediaries while unlocking efficiencies. We believe that blockchains could serve as a robust foundation for the creation
of a new financial system built from the ground up on the internet&#151;what we call<I> the new internet financial system</I>. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>This new internet financial system has the potential to substantially reduce inefficiencies in today&#146;s
financial system</I>.&#8195;Given the amount of value being exchanged in today&#146;s financial system, the benefits of increased efficiency are vast. Trillions of dollars in payments and cross-border remittances occur annually, often at high costs
due to the complex (often multi-party) legacy rails on which they flow. Vast sums of capital are trapped in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">multi-day</FONT> settlement in capital markets, rather than deployed to productive uses. Immense
operational, counterparty, and liquidity risks exist due to the opacity of financial exposures, outdated, manual workflows, and a dependence on cash held in fractional reserve banks. The internet financial system has the potential to address these
inefficiencies by reducing cost and latency, enhancing transparency, and using safer underlying collateral. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The new internet financial system enables
significantly increased money velocity.</I>&#8195;While the potential efficiency benefits of the internet financial system are staggering, we believe these are just a subset of the potential benefits it brings. As the marginal cost of storing and
moving value approaches zero, conditions are ripe for the volume of value exchange to increase exponentially, similar to how the volume of information exchange exploded as the marginal cost of moving data on the internet approached zero. In such a
future, we expect that both the velocity and versatility of money will increase dramatically, as people and businesses are able to transact more freely and frictionlessly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The new internet financial system opens up new opportunities and use cases in finance and commerce through the advent of smart contracts running on
blockchains.</I>&#8195;We believe programmability of money and digital assets represents a major inflection point in the utility of money. Economic arrangements can be literally codified, executed, and enforced entirely online, enabling people and
firms across the world to safely enter into internet-based financial and commercial arrangements, while reducing the need for third-party intermediaries. And, just as the Web and App Stores led to an explosion in innovative information services, the
growth of smart contracts and blockchain-based applications could significantly accelerate innovation in financial services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The new internet financial system
has the potential to increase economic inclusion among underserved populations</I>.&#8195;The existing financial system&#146;s inefficiencies result in the exclusion of certain segments of the global population, particularly those who are poorer,
less educated, and living in rural areas. The new internet financial system has the potential to facilitate the inclusion of the approximately 1.4&nbsp;billion adults globally who, according to the World Bank, are unbanked. The increased inclusion
greatly expands our opportunity set. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>The Circle stablecoin network in the new internet financial system </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Stablecoins (like USDC and EURC) can facilitate the store and transfer of value in the new internet financial system and drive the advancement and adoption of the new
internet financial system.</I>&#8195;Similar to the existing financial system, the internet financial system will facilitate the use of regulated money as a unit of account, a store of value, and as the core medium of exchange within a digitally
native framework. We believe that stablecoins can facilitate the store and transfer of value in the new internet financial system and drive the advancement and adoption of the new internet financial system. Specifically, we believe that payment
stablecoins are the new base layer of internet money. Payment stablecoins function at internet speed (near-instantaneous transacting and settlement), and with programmability that enables the new capabilities and use cases of the internet financial
system. The USDC &#147;digital dollar&#148; issued by us is a leading payment stablecoin, with $43.9&nbsp;billion in circulation across 4.3&nbsp;million meaningful wallets, as of December 31, 2024. We believe that payment stablecoins, their users
and applications, and the use cases built around them will create internet-scale network effects, leading to a market structure in which only a few payment stablecoin platforms will emerge with the critical mass to serve the new internet financial
system. We believe that the Circle stablecoin network is best placed to be a driver of the new internet financial system. See &#147;&#151;Stablecoin overview&#148; for a more detailed description of payment stablecoins. </P>

using it and willing to accept it. In other words, the more users in the network using or willing to use a form of value, the more utility that form of value has, which in turn promotes more
people to use it. This is the case with stablecoins as well. The more people that use a stablecoin, the more utility it has to users (as a store of value and a method of transacting), which in turn drives more people to use it. Furthermore,
stablecoins act as protocols that applications and developers build on top of and integrate. Protocols themselves have network properties&#151;the more applications and products connected to the protocols, the more value the network develops through
both utility and distribution. USDC is the foundation of the Circle stablecoin network, the growth of which is driven by developers building new applications and use cases on the network that are accessible and provide utility to end-users across
the world. Attracting end-users, customers, and developers to adopt the Circle stablecoin network requires that the underlying infrastructure of the digital currencies on the network be robust and safe. Although the Circle stablecoin network carries
risks to our customers and end-users, as is the case with the existing financial system, we nonetheless believe it optimally combines transparency and safety&#151;through regulation as stored-value instruments under FinCEN money services businesses
regulation and state money transmission laws in the United States and as electronic money tokens in Europe, robust and frequent reporting (e.g., daily transparency into the Circle Reserve Fund), monthly assurance, and annual audits&#151;with the
demonstrated reach, critical mass of end-users, world-class financial partners, and network activity to drive the compounding growth and flywheel of internet-scale network effects. </P>

strategy is aimed at growing the Circle stablecoin network and the circulation of Circle stablecoins. To that end, we strive to ensure that Circle Mint customers have readily available access to Circle stablecoins around the globe by working with
financial institutions that act as on- and off-ramps between fiat currency and Circle stablecoins as well as with leading consumer financial applications and payments enterprises. See &#147;&#151;Our platform, products, and ecosystem&#148; for
examples of partners that are part of the Circle stablecoin network and the Circle stablecoin ecosystem. We build and support stablecoin infrastructure that is designed to enable Circle stablecoins to flow safely and easily across blockchain
networks and remove friction and complexity in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-user</FONT> experience for stablecoin transactions. Finally, we provide
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">easy-to-use,</FONT></FONT> cloud-based tools that aim to simplify the underlying technology for developers (whether at startups or within major institutions), and make it easier for
them to build, deploy, and operate innovative applications, with strong <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-the-box</FONT></FONT></FONT> features for using the Circle stablecoin
network. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Critical to our growth strategy are numerous partnerships with leading financial and internet technology firms and ecosystems.</I>&#8195;The underlying
utility (and value) of the Circle stablecoin network is driven by every single end-user, developer, builder, company, and institution operating on it, and the focus of our strategy is to attract and enable a broad ecosystem onto the Circle
stablecoin network. To that end, we partner with leading institutions (many of them category-leading, internet-scale companies) to bring the benefits of the internet financial system to their users by building upon our products. Examples of our
partnership strategy include the recent launches of the first phases of our partnership with Grab to offer its customers in Singapore a decentralized, blockchain-based (Web3) wallet via the Grab app, our partnership with Mercado Libre to introduce
its customers in Latin America to USDC, our partnership with Nubank to introduce its customers in Brazil to USDC, our partnership with SBI Holdings to expand USDC access in Japan, our partnership with Coins.ph to help Filipinos abroad learn to use
USDC for remittances, and our strategic commercial alliance with Binance to convert a portion of its treasury funds into USDC and promote USDC on its platform. In addition, we collaborate with leading global market makers and liquidity providers.
For example, in December 2024, we entered into an agreement with Cumberland to expand liquidity and settlement capabilities in USYC and USDC over the course of a three-year term. Although the details of each partnership differ, in these
partnerships, which have one- to four-year terms, we make payments to our partners (or offer rebates against payments that our partners would otherwise make to us for our Developer Services) based on the number of wallets on our partners&#146;
platforms, the number of wallets on our partners&#146; platforms that transact in USDC, and/or the amount of USDC held on our partners&#146; </P>

platforms. Through these partnerships, we provide our partners with certain Circle products and services and/or incentivize our partners to increase their customers&#146; use of USDC and the
amount of USDC on their platforms, thereby growing the USDC ecosystem and increasing USDC liquidity. We also foster the Circle stablecoin ecosystem with a range of programs, including Circle Developer Programs, which sponsor hackathons and developer
events, the Circle Alliance Program, our global partnership and alliance program, as well as worldwide industry and event sponsorships. Each of these partnerships drives awareness and growth of the Circle stablecoin network, further enhancing its
network effect. We further believe we are uniquely well positioned to attract new partners due to our and USDC&#146;s trusted brand, regulatory-first posture, robust scalable infrastructure, and, critically, the scale and quality of other partners
joining the network. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>Making blockchain technology accessible and easy to use for both developers and end-users will be key to global adoption of stablecoins and

empowering developers to build applications using the Circle stablecoin network. This technical simplification and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-user-focused</FONT> approach is critical to internet-scale adoption of stablecoins broadly and
the Circle stablecoin network specifically. Our core technology offerings, including our blockchain infrastructure products and our Developer Services, are core to enabling an intuitive interface for programmable money across a variety of
applications, which will in turn drive further adoption of the Circle stablecoin network. See &#147;&#151;Our platform, products, and ecosystem&#148; for a more fulsome description of our blockchain infrastructure and Developer Services. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><I>The monetization of the Circle stablecoin network is driven by its growth and our introduction of new products that expand its utility.&#8195;</I>As the Circle
stablecoin network grows, we believe that our ability to monetize it will grow as well. Today, we monetize the amount of money on the network (i.e., the amount of Circle stablecoins in circulation). We earn reserve income on USDC reserve assets, at
rates at a discount to the prevailing SOFR. We believe that our current revenue model has been successful, with 2024 revenue, net income, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion, $156&nbsp;million, and $285&nbsp;million, respectively. See
&#147;Management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations&#151;Non-GAAP financial measures&#148; for reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA. As the Circle stablecoin network grows and as more
applications and activity take place on the Circle stablecoin network, the amount of Circle stablecoins in circulation will continue to grow. In addition to as described in &#147;&#151;Our platform, products, and ecosystem,&#148; we may seek to
monetize the activity on our network with products that earn <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">fee-based</FONT> revenues based on transactions and usage in the future, and we intend to evaluate and consider various products from time to time,
considering such factors as complexity and development costs, market opportunity, anticipated revenues, and the competitive landscape. However, we do not have any plans to launch such additional products that are expected to generate material
amounts of fee-based revenues at this time. We believe the market opportunity in the internet financial system is vast and that, although we face a variety of risks (see &#147;Risk factors&#148; for a discussion of the material risks faced by our

stablecoins and related products together provide a network utility and application platform for a wide range of organizations to benefit from stablecoins and the new internet financial system. Through our partners and the broader ecosystem that
supports and integrates into the Circle stablecoin network, we touch more than 600 million users around the world as of March 28, 2025. While we do not provide direct services to individuals, (other than by redeeming USDC and EURC in our role as the
redeemer of last resort), the Circle stablecoin network is one of the most widely used on the internet&#151;as of March 28, 2025, USDC has been used for more than $25 trillion in onchain transactions. </P>

Stablecoins </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">At the foundation of the Circle stablecoin network are the USDC and EURC payment stablecoins. USDC and EURC are digital currency tokens issued
natively on blockchain networks and backed by reserves consisting of highly liquid, price-stable cash and cash equivalents. USDC and EURC are redeemable on a one-for-one basis for U.S. dollars and euros, respectively, directly from us by Circle Mint
customers (see &#147;&#151;Our platform, products, and ecosystem&#151;Circle Liquidity Services&#151;Circle Mint&#148; for information about Circle Mint, which is a service offering that is available only to institutions) as well as by end-users
that are not Circle Mint customers in our role as the redeemer of last resort (see &#147;Glossary&#151;The issuers of Circle stablecoins&#148;). In addition, all end-users can sell or exchange USDC and EURC in the secondary market. USDC and EURC
enable end-users to store value in a digital form and to transact over blockchain networks, allowing for near-instant settlement, at a very low cost, with the reach of the internet. USDC and EURC are regulated as stored-value instruments under
FinCEN money services businesses regulation and state money transmission laws in the United States and as electronic money tokens in Europe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We believe Circle
stablecoins have consistently set a standard for transparency, liquidity, and technological innovation. They are exclusively issued by Circle, and are directly obtainable through Circle Mint, which is available only to institutions (see
&#147;&#151;Circle Mint&#148; for information about Circle Mint). Circle stablecoins are also distributed and made widely available through hundreds of different retail and institutional products around the world. They can also be stored in digital

Funds </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Circle Tokenized Funds are regulated yield-bearing investments for collateral use in capital markets. We believe that certain major trading firms have
moved, and will increasingly move away from, using stablecoins as collateral in favor of TMMFs. However, other TMMF issuers may be limited in their ability to provide significant instantaneous redeemability for equivalent underlying assets. We
believe that the ability of a well-regulated stablecoin such as USDC to provide near-instantaneous redemption can offer a substantial advantage for this emerging trend of using TMMFs as collateral for margin trading on various digital asset trading
platforms, maximizing capital efficiency in the flows between settlement assets and collateral and at the same time, reducing counterparty execution risk. Moreover, TMMF issuers typically operate on a single blockchain or have limited
interoperability across different blockchain platforms. By integrating TMMFs with Circle&#146;s existing infrastructure, we expect to enhance interoperability and enable investors to quickly transition between TMMFs and stablecoins, allowing traders
to hold their assets in TMMFs while accruing yield and then be able to instantaneously convert into Circle stablecoins, which can then be used to purchase other digital assets on third party platforms. </P>

payment stablecoins that offer no yield, TMMFs like USYC offer yield to the token holders that is generated from its invested assets consisting primarily of reverse repurchase agreements on U.S. government and government-backed securities and
short-term U.S. Treasury securities. According to RWA.xyz, USYC is the largest onchain TMMF in terms of assets under management, with approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2024. We believe that leveraging

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Since the beta launch of Circle Wallets, more than 11,000 developers have engaged with the product, deploying almost 10 million wallets onchain. For
example, Grab Networks, a leading superapp in Southeast Asia, has implemented Circle&#146;s solutions to power its new onchain wallet, beginning with NFT-based stored value vouchers that can be used in real-world commerce. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">To streamline both developer and end-user experiences of onchain apps, we also offer Circle Gas Station, a feature within Circle Wallets, which enables
application developers to remove the need for end-users to pay gas fees for using blockchain applications. This allows end-users to simply interact with apps (i.e., make and receive stablecoin payments) without ever knowing they are using a
blockchain or what a gas fee even represents. Circle Gas Station allows developers to set policies for fees and limits, and if fees need to be paid by end-users, it allows those fees to be paid entirely in USDC, removing friction typically
associated with using blockchain applications. Behind the scenes, we automatically handle the integration with blockchain networks and the underlying gas fee infrastructure on behalf of developers. </P>

has become important for end-users to be able to easily and safely transfer stablecoins across different blockchain networks. For most end-users, the process of making a transfer across blockchain networks is cumbersome, expensive, slow, and
introduces significant security and financial integrity risks. Blockchains have generally not been interoperable with each other, contributing to difficulties bridging from one chain to another. The only way for most end-users to move value across
blockchains has been to use a &#147;wrapped token,&#148; or a tokenized representation of a particular digital asset that enables it to be operable on another blockchain. Such protocols introduce undue risk and hacking opportunities into a process
that should otherwise be simple and hassle-free. </P></TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">To address these issues, we launched CCTP. With CCTP, end-users can safely and

interacting with. In March 2025, we launched CCTP V2, a fast version of CCTP that monetizes and accrues revenue on each transaction. CCTP V2 is currently available on Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, and Linea, with more blockchains expected to be

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The Circle stablecoin network benefits from the strength, operating resiliency, and risk management capabilities of the leading financial institutions that are part of
our reserve management infrastructure. We hold reserves in a manner designed to ensure liquidity and preservation of reserve assets. See &#147;&#151;Reserve management standard&#148; for information regarding our standards for managing Circle
stablecoin reserves. In compliance with applicable laws and regulatory guidance, we (i) limit Circle stablecoin reserves to highly liquid financial instruments, (ii) hold reserves in accounts that are titled FBO holders of USDC and EURC,
respectively, and (iii) do not lend, borrow against, or encumber the reserves. See &#147;&#151;Regulatory policy landscape&#151;Principal U.S. federal and state regulatory regimes&#151;Money transmitter and money services laws&#148; for a discussion
of the regulations governing our U.S. state licenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately 85% of USDC reserves in the Circle Reserve Fund, a government
money market fund pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act managed by BlackRock, one of the world&#146;s largest asset managers, and available only to us. The assets within the Circle Reserve Fund are held in the custody of BNY, one of the largest
asset custodians in the world. See &#147;Management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations&#151;Liquidity and capital resources&#151;Composition of USDC reserves&#148; for additional information regarding the
Circle Reserve Fund. The remaining portion of USDC reserves (typically 10-20%) are held as cash in accounts that are titled FBO holders of USDC, primarily with banks designated by the Financial Stability Board as GSIBs, which are subject to the
highest capital and liquidity requirements and the greatest level of regulatory supervision in the world. A small fraction of USDC reserves is held as cash within several additional banks, which facilitate the flow of funds from reserves to Circle
Mint customers. Currently, all EURC reserves are held only in cash. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Core to our reserve management infrastructure is reporting and independent assurance. Since the
launch of USDC in September 2018 and EURC in June 2022, we have provided full transparency into assets comprising Circle stablecoin reserves, first on a monthly basis (on our website), then on a weekly basis (also on our website), and now, in the
case of the Circle Reserve Fund, on a daily basis (on BlackRock&#146;s website). Furthermore, since USDC&#146;s launch, we have provided the public with independent, third-party monthly assurance over the value and composition of these assets from a
leading public accounting firm (currently, a Big Four firm), whose reports are available for both USDC and EURC on our website. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B></B><I>Our Liquidity Services
are integrated with the existing financial system</I><B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Additionally, core to Circle Liquidity Services is our integration with the existing financial system
in order to provide robust primary liquidity (i.e., facilitating conversions between Circle stablecoins and fiat currency). We believe we have built a robust banking infrastructure, with onboarding at settlement banks that provide the primary market
liquidity infrastructure to enable us to flow funds to and from Circle Mint customers to enable on- and off-ramping with Circle stablecoins. They provide multiple rails including 24/7/365 funds flow capabilities, wires, ACH, SEPA, and similar
regional domestic bank transfer networks as well as providing redundancy across rails. We continue to expand the network of banks that provide primary Liquidity Services to the Circle stablecoin ecosystem. </P>

30% of the reserves backing stablecoins issued by Circle Internet Financial Europe SAS in separate accounts in credit institutions and the remaining portions must only be invested in highly liquid financial instruments with minimal market risk,

reverse repurchase agreements on an overnight basis fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, in which the collateral is market-priced greater than the allocated cash amount at the time of purchase and custodied with a third-party custodian

financial instruments is limited solely to eligible assets set forth in the preceding (i) through (iv). In addition, our reserve management standard limits the types of assets that may be included in EURC reserves to (i) cash deposits at global
banks, (ii) tri-party reverse repurchase agreements on an overnight basis, over-collateralized by eligible assets that constitute reserve assets under MiCAR, with appropriate margins determined based on then-current market conditions and volatility
of the specific eligible assets used as collateral, (iii) euro-denominated sovereign debt securities, (iv) qualifying government bond Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities funds, and (v) other financial instruments
including digital tokenized products, where the underlying asset composition of such financial instruments is limited solely to eligible assets set forth in the preceding (i) through (iv). </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Our reserve management committee provides governance, oversight, and accountability around the management of Circle stablecoin reserves. The committee is chaired by our
Chief Financial Officer, and members include senior level executives across Risk, Legal, Finance, Product, and Policy. Currently, the voting members of the committee are our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President and Chief Legal
Officer, Vice President of Product, Chief Economist, and Head of Financial Risk. Committee members are designated by the committee&#146;s charter based on the offices they hold in our company. Changes in membership require approval by the committee.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The committee sets the strategy for reserve management, approves guidelines and limits within which day-to-day reserve management should be conducted, and approves
changes to the strategy, limits, and any exceptions or changes to our reserve management standard. In considering changes to our reserve management strategy, limits, and any exceptions or changes to our reserve management standard, the reserve

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We are building what we believe will be the largest and most widely used stablecoin network in the world. The Circle stablecoin network boasts numerous strengths and
advantages relative to traditional payments systems and networks and alternative stablecoin networks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Core to the internet financial system </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The Circle stablecoin network allows value to be transmitted at the speed and efficiency of the internet, enabling it to be far more flexible, frictionless, and
widespread than traditional fiat networks. These features enable us to target large market opportunities across remittance, payments, digital asset markets, and capital markets more broadly. Additionally, Circle stablecoins are flexible and
programmable, unlocking new and innovative applications made possible on the internet financial system. As more applications are created on the Circle stablecoin network, the network and underlying infrastructure underpinning the activities on the
platform become increasingly robust, driving powerful network effects and growing usage exponentially. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Category-defining product infrastructure </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We believe our USDC platform has a number of advantages over other digital asset protocols. USDC has a robust <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-</FONT> and <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-ramp</FONT> architecture, creating a substantial number of bridges between fiat and digital currencies. As a result, USDC has the ability to comprehensively serve end-user needs, particularly for use cases involving
transacting in, or between, traditional fiat and digital currencies. In addition, USDC has the greatest interoperability across multiple public blockchains, and continues to expand its ability to operate on new chains. Currently, USDC is natively
supported for, and natively flows across, 19 blockchains enabled by our blockchain infrastructure. Lastly, we greatly simplify the developer and end-user experience on these blockchains with Developer Services, including Circle Contracts, CCTP,
Circle Paymaster, and Circle Wallets, along with features of Circle Wallets like Circle Gas Station, encouraging continued interaction and innovation in the Circle stablecoin ecosystem. We believe our ability to interoperate with, and be supported
by, many of the most used blockchains will enable us to scale much more rapidly than our competitors and will drive increasing adoption of Circle stablecoins by enabling access and utilization by different user bases who may operate on different
blockchains. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Robust partnership ecosystem </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We support the
stability and growth of the Circle stablecoin network by developing partnerships with industry leaders across financial services and technology sectors. For example, USDC reserves are held in accounts with regulated financial institutions, including
BlackRock and BNY, that are titled FBO holders of USDC. Strategic partnerships such as the ones with Grab and Mercado Libre help deepen the distribution and liquidity of USDC in key markets. They also help to grow global USDC adoption more broadly.
We believe our combination of industry leadership and regulation-first approach uniquely positions us as the partner of choice for companies looking to explore and innovate with digital assets and blockchain networks. In addition, we and Coinbase

million Circle Wallets on our platform, enabling the development of a wide range of applications across gaming, payments, and commerce. We also foster the developer ecosystem, with programs such as the Circle Ecosystem Grant and Circle Ventures,
which provide financing and technical resources to promote developer activity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Safety and regulatory leadership </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Fundamental to our business model is our focus on working with regulators around the world to develop and implement frameworks that will make working with and using
stablecoins a safe and secure endeavor. We believe that end-user safety and the soundness of the Circle stablecoin network are critical to our success and provide a competitive advantage within the stablecoin and broader digital assets ecosystems.
Circle stablecoins are regulated as a form of stored value under laws governing money transmission in the United States and many other countries. Circle stablecoin reserves are also regulated. We limit Circle stablecoin reserves to highly liquid
financial instruments. See &#147;&#151;Reserve management standard.&#148; Reserve assets are primarily held in custody at BNY. Lastly, we have robust operational risk processes and controls, including comprehensive KYC and AML programs. As a result
of our proven track record and our ongoing leadership in driving regulatory frameworks related to stablecoins, we believe we are best positioned to be the digital currency platform of choice for individuals, enterprises, and developers alike. </P>

benefit of our customers, end-users, and the industry as a whole. Our attestation reports, currently attested to by a Big Four accounting firm, are published publicly on a monthly basis and have been since 2018. The attestations independently assert
that the fair value of the assets we hold in reserve are greater than or equal to the amount of USDC in circulation. In accordance with NYDFS guidance, each attestation includes two report dates, including as of the last business day of each month.
The attestations provide detail of the reserves, including the amount of cash held at banks as well as the CUSIP, maturity date, and fair value of every Treasury obligation held in the Circle Reserve Fund, the fair value of the U.S. Treasury reverse
repurchase agreements held in the Circle Reserve Fund, and the amount of cash held in the Circle Reserve Fund. Additionally, we publish the amount of Circle stablecoins held in circulation, our balance of reserves, the composition of the entire
reserve base, and minting and redemption statistics on a weekly basis, and the balances in the Circle Reserve Fund are disclosed daily. We believe our focus on transparency is a key differentiator that will enable us to build the most trusted
stablecoin network in the world. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The aggregate effect of these strengths solidifies our position as a market-leading brand in the digital asset and broader FinTech

according to CoinMarketCap. Other competitive stablecoins include white-labeled stablecoins issued and operated by Paxos, including PayPal USD, a stablecoin that is integrated into PayPal wallet
products, which has experienced limited distribution and adoption to date, but remains a potentially significant competitor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We also indirectly compete with other
payment systems and innovations, including offerings being explored by national governments and central banks, where a number of developments are underway to improve upon legacy government payment systems infrastructure. For example, Real-Time
Payments is a payment processing protocol which has been used by banks in the United States since 2017 to send money electronically among each other, and the more recent FedNow program is a real-time payment and settlement service for individuals
and businesses provided by the Federal Reserve. However, these initiatives are merely enhancements to traditional banking and payment constructs, are often focused on specific regions, and do not directly compete against stablecoin networks and
open, blockchain-based financial infrastructure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Additionally, some major financial institutions such as J.P. Morgan are expanding their use of blockchain
technology for digital asset applications and private stablecoin issuance. As other major financial institutions explore new alternative payment systems, we believe these institutions have the potential to be some of the biggest clients of
blockchain financial services, and by extension Circle. Some have integrated blockchain technologies to offer faster cross-border payments and reduced settlement times, while other banks have explored issuing stablecoins. Our focus on building
stablecoin networks on public internet infrastructure and open blockchain networks differentiates us from these closed-network projects, allowing for greater reach, interoperability, and ongoing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">developer-led</FONT>
innovation of the Circle stablecoin network. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Further, some countries and central banks are also exploring initiatives to create CBDCs. A CBDC is a digital form of a
country&#146;s fiat currency that is issued, regulated, and backed by its central bank. For example, China and Sweden have formally launched live pilot CBDC programs while others such as the United Kingdom have announced preliminary initiatives to
explore the benefits of CBDCs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We are witnessing a rapidly growing trend in asset tokenization. The ability to convert real-world assets into digital assets on a
blockchain has presented new challenges for competition beyond the scope of stablecoins. For example, major asset management firms such as BlackRock and WisdomTree are launching their own TMMFs for a range of financial services use cases. Traders
are becoming more receptive to this move, as it allows them to earn yield while using these tokens as collateral. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As a result of our developer-oriented platform and
network infrastructure, we may in the future compete and/or partner with more traditional financial and technology firms. Evident by our growing partnerships with companies such as Visa, Stripe, MoneyGram, and Grab, we envision a complex ecosystem
that will accommodate multiple segments of players, including companies aiming to integrate stablecoins and blockchain networks into their products. </P>

a joint venture with Coinbase to provide independent governance over various aspects of USDC (such as reserve backing) and to own various elements of stablecoin-related intellectual property with the goal of having multiple parties issue USDC and
other stablecoins. The Centre Consortium was owned 50% by us and 50% by Coinbase and was managed by a board of managers composed of three individuals, each holding one vote with respect to matters to be decided by the board of managers: one manager
designated by us, one manager designated by Coinbase, and one independent manager mutually agreed to between us and Coinbase. The board of managers had broad authority in managing the Centre Consortium&#146;s business and the governing framework for

criteria to become a member or participant of the consortium and the approval of the network rules that govern the stablecoins under the consortium. Around that time, in order to incentivize
Coinbase to distribute USDC, we entered into an agreement with Coinbase related to the distribution of USDC. Pursuant to the agreement, we shared any revenue generated from USDC reserves pro rata based on the amount of USDC distributed by each
respective party and the amount of USDC held on each respective party&#146;s platform in relation to the total amount of USDC in circulation. Coinbase did not have any specific obligations to distribute or otherwise transact upon USDC once issued by
us. However, the foregoing payment structure provided incentives for Coinbase to distribute USDC, thereby growing the usage of USDC and increasing USDC liquidity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In August 2023, we restructured our relationship with Coinbase through a Collaboration Agreement that we believe will incentivize both parties to continue to work
together to grow the Circle stablecoin network and that provides Circle with sole governance over the Circle stablecoin network. This agreement also afforded Coinbase a minority equity stake in Circle. We believe that our strong alliance with the
leading U.S. digital asset exchange will enable us to continue to grow USDC and the Circle stablecoin network. We also entered an intellectual property license agreement (the &#147;License Agreement&#148;) with Coinbase, under which we granted to
Coinbase a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (other than to certain software and service providers), royalty-free right to use certain trademarks (the &#147;Licensed Marks&#148;) related to current and potential future
Circle stablecoins, including USDC and EURC, in connection with the advertising, promotion, marketing, commercialization, sale, distribution, provision, and receipt of such stablecoins. The term of the License Agreement is perpetual but the
agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Under the Collaboration Agreement, Coinbase is expected to allow its customers to buy and sell USDC on its
platform in exchange for fiat (the &#147;reseller threshold&#148;), support USDC for use by its customers on a number of blockchains, protocols, products or services (the &#147;product threshold&#148;), and actively contribute to public policy and
regulatory activities encouraging mainstream adoption of USDC. The payment structure of the Collaboration Agreement incentivizes Coinbase to grow the usage of USDC and increase USDC liquidity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The Collaboration Agreement has an initial three-year term. We and Coinbase may agree to renew the Collaboration Agreement for additional periods. Prior to the lapse of
the term, we and Coinbase will discuss in good faith whether any modifications to the Collaboration Agreement are warranted. If we and Coinbase cannot agree on such modifications, so long as we and Coinbase have met our ongoing obligations under the
Collaboration Agreement, the Collaboration Agreement will renew for an additional three-year term. If we fail to meet our ongoing obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, upon expiration of the then-current term, Coinbase may elect to
terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its sole discretion. If Coinbase fails to meet the product threshold or the reseller threshold with respect to USDC or any other stablecoin under the Collaboration Agreement, and in each case, fails to cure
as provided for under the Collaboration Agreement and we and Coinbase do not reach mutual agreement with respect to renewal of the Collaboration Agreement, we may elect to exclude the party product economics or the ecosystem economics (each as
defined below), respectively, for the applicable stablecoin from the monthly payment owed to Coinbase in accordance with the terms set forth in the Collaboration Agreement. The Collaboration Agreement provides that for USDC and any other stablecoin
using the Licensed Marks, we make payments to Coinbase for its role in the distribution of USDC and growth in the USDC ecosystem. These payments are determined based on the daily income generated from the reserves backing such stablecoin, less the
management fees charged by non-affiliated third parties for managing such reserves (such as asset management and custody fees) and certain other expenses, which is referred to as the &#147;payment base.&#148; From this payment base, (i)&nbsp;we

Coinbase&#146;s case, subject to our right of first refusal) to launch new stablecoins using the Licensed Marks that do not already correspond to an existing stablecoin. Any new stablecoins would be subject to the same economic arrangements as USDC.

either case, the parties will first try to amend the Collaboration Agreement or restructure their operations within a certain period of time (the &#147;restructuring period&#148;) to avoid such violation. If the amendment or restructuring proves
ineffective or we do not resume payment to Coinbase with respect to such stablecoin under the Collaboration Agreement following the restructuring period, upon Coinbase&#146;s written request, the Licensed Marks with respect to the relevant
stablecoin would &#147;flip,&#148; in which case we would assign such Licensed Marks to Coinbase, the License Agreement would terminate with respect to such Licensed Marks, and the parties would enter into a new license agreement for such Licensed
Marks. Coinbase would in turn grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and largely non-sublicensable right to use these flipped trademarks in connection with the advertising, promotion, marketing, commercialization, issuance, sale,
distribution, development, provision, and receipt of such stablecoin. In addition, if such a flipped trademark situation were to occur with respect to USDC, under certain circumstances, we would be prohibited from issuing other U.S.
dollar-denominated stablecoins. See &#147;Risk factors&#151;Risks related to intellectual property&#151;Our Collaboration Agreement with Coinbase could cause us to lose ownership or use of our trademarks upon the occurrence of certain events.&#148;

participants&#148;) that provide incentives to such approved participants to increase the circulation of stablecoins subject to the Collaboration Agreement. In anticipation of such arrangements, in November 2024, we and Coinbase entered into a
supplement to the Collaboration Agreement (the &#147;Stablecoin Ecosystem Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which we and Coinbase agreed that, prior to a third party becoming an approved participant under the Stablecoin Ecosystem Agreement, we and
Coinbase will agree on (i) the portion of the residual payment base that such third party will be eligible to receive upon becoming an approved participant and (ii) the undertakings to be required of such third party upon becoming an approved
participant as a condition to receiving such portion of the residual payment base. Amounts payable to approved participants are deducted from the residual payment base prior to allocating the remaining residual payment base between us and Coinbase.

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In April 2022, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with BlackRock (as amended and restated, the &#147;MOU&#148;). In the MOU, the parties expressed their
intention to collaborate in a number of areas relating to stablecoins, including exploring, over the three-year term of the MOU, capital market applications for USDC. In addition, we appointed BlackRock as the exclusive manager of USDC reserves
during the term of the MOU, other than up to 20% of USDC cash reserves that we may keep in bank deposits. We granted BlackRock a right of first refusal to be the preferred asset manager for similar arrangements for cash reserves of other stablecoins
that we may issue, and we granted BlackRock the right to notice of certain material capital and strategic transactions we may undertake. Further, subject to BlackRock&#146;s internal approvals and SEC registration, BlackRock anticipated launching an
SEC-registered money market fund that is specific to us and which would invest in high-quality assets in compliance with government money market fund requirements pursuant to Rule&nbsp;2a-7 under the 1940 Act; we anticipated subscribing to the fund
after its registration with the SEC. Pursuant to this plan, BlackRock launched the Circle Reserve Fund in 2023, but such Reserve Fund is not governed by the terms of the MOU and is therefore not impacted by it. See &#147;Management&#146;s discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations&#151;Liquidity and capital resources&#151;Composition of USDC reserves&#148; for additional information regarding the Circle Reserve Fund. In connection with the activities contemplated
by the MOU, in September 2023, we and BlackRock entered into a license agreement that granted each party a revocable non-exclusive license to use the other party&#146;s specified trademarks for permitted purposes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Prior to the expiration of the MOU, we entered into a new memorandum of understanding with BlackRock in March 2025 (as amended and restated, the &#147;New MOU&#148;),
which substantially replaces the MOU. Under the terms of the New MOU, we agreed to treat BlackRock as our preferred partner for managing stablecoin reserves and agreed to prioritize, where possible, holding our reserves for the issuance of Circle
stablecoins and other products with BlackRock. In particular, we committed to maintaining at least 90% of our U.S.-managed fiat reserves for USDC (excluding bank deposits) with BlackRock managed products, unless legal, regulatory, or operational
requirements mandate otherwise. Furthermore, BlackRock agreed to prioritize and prefer USDC and all Circle stablecoins for all U.S. dollar payment stablecoin-related use cases and committed not to develop and launch a competitive payment stablecoin,

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Despite their relatively recent emergence, digital assets generally&#151;and stablecoins in particular&#151;are currently subject to extensive and complex regulatory
regimes globally. These regimes include those related to financial services and banking, electronic payments, money transmission and payment services, virtual currencies, market conduct, and unclaimed property. Through many of these regimes, we are
subject to increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements relating to the detection and prevention of money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, and the prevention of fraud and other illicit activity. In addition, regulations
pertaining to competition, economic and trade sanctions, privacy, cybersecurity, information security, and data protection are also applicable to our business. While many of these regulatory regimes were designed to regulate traditional financial
activities and were established before the advent of digital assets and stablecoins, governments and regulatory authorities are increasingly proposing and adopting additional regulatory regimes or changes to existing regulatory regimes tailored to
digital assets. The result is a rapidly and frequently evolving and expanding set of regulations that apply to our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Our &#147;regulation-first&#148;
philosophy </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">At Circle, we have adopted a &#147;regulation-first&#148; philosophy that underlies our operations and led us to build a robust compliance
infrastructure. We are subject to substantial regulation, particularly when compared to other firms in the blockchain technology and digital assets sector. Our compliance program focuses on a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by U.S.
federal, state, and local governments, foreign governments, and supra-national regulatory authorities. We are proud to be among the most regulatory-compliant companies in the digital assets industry. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Looking toward the future, we are also at the forefront of advocacy for sound financial regulation. We have proactively and collaboratively worked with U.S. governmental
authorities and regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department (including its relevant bureaus and agencies such as the OCC, FinCEN, and OFAC), the CFTC, and the SEC. We routinely engage with U.S. federal, state, and
international policymakers and relevant supra-national bodies in proposals for the comprehensive regulation of stablecoins and other aspects of the digital assets ecosystem. In the future, as various jurisdictions increasingly recognize the value of
stablecoins, we envision many of these regulatory regimes will be revised to impose more tailored, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">fit-for-purpose</FONT></FONT> requirements on stablecoin issuers that align with the
unique benefits and risks that such digital assets pose. Indeed, Circle already voluntarily imposes on itself and satisfies many of the requirements contemplated by pending draft legislation and proposed regulation. We therefore believe that Circle
is well positioned to benefit from greater regulatory clarity in the United States and beyond. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Principal U.S. federal and state regulatory regimes

limitations on the investment of customer funds, including strict fiduciary obligations and limits investments of reserves to specific categories of investments; and examination by state and federal regulatory agencies. Under the regulations
governing our MTLs, we must hold assets that underly our outstanding money transmission obligations (i.e., reserve assets that underly Circle stablecoins), for the benefit of holders of Circle stablecoins and are prohibited from lending, pledging,
rehypothecating, or otherwise encumbering reserve assets. In addition, under the regulations governing our MTLs, except in limited circumstances, such as when prohibited by law or court order or instances where fraud is suspected, we are required to
honor outstanding stored value and payment instrument obligations (i.e., Circle stablecoins) of customers (i.e., we are required to honor redemptions by Circle Mint customers) even if reserve assets and the proceeds from reserve assets are
insufficient to do so. In such situations, we must use our corporate funds and resources to satisfy any shortfall. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In addition, Circle Internet Financial, LLC was
the first company approved for a BitLicense by the NYDFS, which is required for any person that engages in virtual currency business activity in New York or with New York customers. The BitLicense enables Circle Internet Financial, LLC to engage in
virtual currency exchanging and trading services, electronic money transmitting with virtual currencies, issuing prepaid access/stored value with virtual currencies, and selling prepaid access/stored value with virtual currencies. Circle Internet
Financial, LLC also holds a Virtual Currency License from the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions, which, like the BitLicense issued by the NYDFS, is required for any person that engages in virtual currency business activity in Louisiana or
with Louisiana customers. These licenses impose additional requirements on how we maintain the Circle stablecoin reserves. For example, regulations governing the BitLicense and related NYDFS guidance requires, among other things, that (i)
stablecoins must be fully backed by reserve assets, (ii) reserves must be available for timely redemptions, (iii) reserves must be segregated from the proprietary assets of the issuer and held in custody for the benefit of holders of Circle
stablecoins with U.S. state or federally chartered depository institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC and/or asset custodians approved in advance by the NYDFS, (iv)&nbsp;reserves must be limited to specified assets such as U.S. Treasury bills
with maturities of three months or less, reverse repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury obligations, government money market funds, and deposit accounts at U.S. state or federally chartered depository institutions, and (v)
reserves must be attested to monthly and annually by a certified public accountant. In addition, regulations governing the BitLicense as well as regulations governing our Virtual Currency License prohibit us from lending, pledging, rehypothecating,
or otherwise encumbering reserve assets. Other jurisdictions are expected to require similar licenses. For example, California&#146;s Digital Financial Assets law will require persons engaging in digital asset business activities to obtain a license
from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation when the law comes into effect on July&nbsp;1, 2025. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">While our MTLs and money services
business registration status subject us to regulations that govern material aspects of our business&#151;for example, how we commercialize Circle stablecoins, onboard customers, and maintain adequate reserves to fully back Circle
stablecoins&#151;such regulation is not equivalent to the type of prudential regulation and supervision that applies to regulated banks, such as under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, National Bank Act, Bank Holding Company Act, and the Federal

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Circle&#146;s long-standing view is that payment stablecoins&#151;such as USDC and EURC&#151;are not &#147;securities&#148; as defined in the U.S. federal securities
laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Our view is supported by a recent federal court finding in <I>Binance v. the SEC</I> where the court found implausible the SEC&#146;s allegation that Binance&#146;s promises to develop the
BUSD &#147;ecosystem&#148; would lead purchasers to expect an increase in value &#147;when the alleged defining feature of the &#145;stablecoin&#146; was that its value would remain constant.&#148; The court further noted that &#147;it may be more
difficult to make the <I>Howey</I> showing when stablecoins are involved.&#148; We acknowledge that while neither the SEC nor any other U.S. federal or state regulator has challenged our position that Circle stablecoins are not securities, and our
position is consistent with the court&#146;s findings with respect to BUSD, no U.S. regulator has stated publicly whether it agrees with our assessment. Our conclusion, even if reasonable under the circumstances, would not preclude legal or
regulatory action based on such a finding that USDC is a &#147;security.&#148; See &#147;Risk factors&#151;Risks related to our business and industry&#151;Absent federal regulations, there is a possibility that Circle stablecoins may be classified

JFSA-licensed intermediaries under the Payment Services Act. This structure requires: (1) licensing of local USDC distributors (&#147;EPIESPs&#148;) by the Japan Financial Services Agency; (2) holding of eligible fiat reserves in trust, administered
by a Japanese trust bank; and (3) a trust agreement involving Circle and the licensed EPIESPs. Circle engaged Shinsei Trust Bank as Trustee to administer the trust and hold eligible reserves according to its reserve management standard for the
benefit of all USDC holders. The reserves held pursuant to this arrangement must meet or exceed the total value of USDC custodied and reported by the EPIESPs on behalf of their customers, but the reserves are not earmarked for those EPIESPs or their

<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">There are a growing number of jurisdictions where Circle is not currently licensed that are recognizing the real-world utility of payment stablecoins. As a consequence,
we are seeing new regulatory frameworks emerge to which we may one day be subject. For example, in September 2023, Dubai&#146;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority enacted clear rules for the issuance of a &#147;Fiat-Referenced Virtual Asset,&#148;
and USDC/EURC are approved as recognized crypto tokens by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. In Canada, Circle became the first stablecoin issuer to comply with the new listing requirements in the Canadian Securities Administrators&#146;
Value-Referenced Crypto Asset regime and is in full compliance with the Ontario Securities Commission regulations. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is currently engaged in a public consultation process on a legislative proposal to
regulate issuers of stablecoins within Hong Kong. We believe the regulatory frameworks in Dubai and Hong Kong are largely consistent with Circle&#146;s existing redemption, reserve, and transparency practices. The emergence of regulatory frameworks
tailored to stablecoins in key financial hubs evidences a growing recognition among advanced economies that digital assets like USDC and EURC may play a critical role in the future of financial markets and payment systems.</P>

traditional security controls, we further protect digital assets via strong key management controls, the offline storage of funds, financial &#147;circuit breaker&#148; controls, and other controls specific to preventing cyberattacks against

transaction-level reporting. As of December 27, 2024, lawsuits have been filed challenging this rulemaking. Accordingly, it is unclear whether and to what extent these requirements will remain in force. These requirements may be onerous to

of these obligations may be constructively imposed on us, we seek to account for them in our commercial agreements. For example, bank regulators generally require that they have the ability to exercise audit rights with respect to their regulated

stablecoins are redeemable on a one-for-one basis for the respective underlying fiat currencies. We base this statement on the current state of our company and operations. See &#147;&#151;Our platform, products, and ecosystem&#151;Circle Liquidity
Services&#151;Circle Mint&#148; and &#147;Glossary&#151;The issuers of Circle stablecoins&#148; for more information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We place great importance on safeguarding
Circle stablecoin reserves and keeping them bankruptcy remote from our general creditors. As a consequence, we believe that Circle stablecoins are structured in a manner that entitles the holder to absolute beneficial ownership of the underlying
reserve assets, given that we hold only bare legal title to the underlying assets but have no beneficial interest or property rights in such assets. Therefore, the reserve assets backing USDC and EURC, beyond the bare legal title that we hold,
should not be considered property of our bankruptcy estate in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency. Due to the novelty of stablecoins, however, courts have not yet considered the treatment of underlying reserve assets in the context of a
bankruptcy or insolvency of a stablecoin issuer and have only issued a limited number of rulings related to digital assets in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency. Should a court conclude&#151;consistent with our position&#151;that the
underlying reserve assets are the property of stablecoin holders, and not the bankruptcy estate, stablecoin holders may still experience delays in recovering the underlying assets due to, among other things, bankruptcy administration, ongoing
litigation, or application of the automatic stay. At the same time, it is possible that a U.S. court, in the case of USDC, or a French court, in the case of EURC, could instead determine that the reserve assets backing USDC and EURC, respectively,
are property of our bankruptcy estate. If this were to happen, other creditors of Circle may be able to obtain recoveries from the underlying reserve assets and holders of Circle stablecoins could be treated as general unsecured creditors of Circle,
which could result in Circle stablecoin holders receiving only partial recoveries rather than the full purported value of their stablecoin holdings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We will
continue to monitor legal, regulatory, and other developments in order to take reasonable and appropriate steps to continue the safeguarding of Circle stablecoin reserves. </P>

on August&nbsp;22, 2013 and most recently amended on June 30, 2024 in connection with the Redomiciliation. The 2013 Scheme provides for the grant of awards, consisting of options, conditional share awards, and restricted share awards to employees,
directors, and consultants of Circle or any of its subsidiaries. In connection with our Redomiciliation, Circle Internet Group, Inc. has agreed to assume and fulfill the obligations of Circle Internet Financial Limited with respect to awards
outstanding under the 2013 Scheme as of immediately prior to the Redomiciliation. Accordingly, upon the exercise or settlement, as applicable, of awards outstanding under the 2013 Scheme, Circle Internet Group, Inc. will issue to the awardholder one
share of Class A common stock for each fully paid voting ordinary share of Circle Internet Financial Limited (a &#147;Scheme Share&#148;) underlying the exercised or settled award. Following the Redomiciliation, no further grants of any awards were
or will be made under the 2013 Scheme. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The board of directors is responsible for the administration of the 2013 Scheme and may, from time to time, make or amend

administration of the 2013 Scheme, including the resolution of any ambiguity of the rules in the 2013 Scheme, is final and binding. The board of directors may also terminate or, from time to
time, suspend the grant of awards. The board of directors may also make, subject to certain restrictions, amendments to the rules of the 2013&nbsp;Scheme or any subplans. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Generally, an award is granted by the execution by Circle of an award certificate, which provides information regarding the award&#146;s date of grant, the number of
shares issued pursuant to the award, vesting schedule, exercisability (if applicable), whether an option is an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; under the Code or a nonqualified stock option, and transfer restrictions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In the case of options, the board of directors has absolute discretion to determine the exercise price; <I>provided</I> that such exercise price cannot be less than the
nominal value of a Scheme Share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">With the exception of an individual&#146;s death or in the event of a corporate transaction, awards are not capable of being
transferred, charged, or otherwise alienated. Any time an award holder purports to make one of these transfers, the award shall lapse immediately. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The maximum
number of Scheme Shares which may be the subject of awards under the 2013 Scheme may not exceed 65,313,680. Where an award has lapsed, been renounced, or otherwise becomes incapable of vesting, it shall not be counted towards the limit. If an award
is granted that causes the maximum limit to be exceeded, then only the awards which do not cause the limit to be exceeded shall be effective. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Subject to certain
provisions of the 2013 Scheme, no award can be exercised after the tenth anniversary of the date of grant (the seventh anniversary for an Irish tax resident). With the exception of certain special circumstances, an award can only be exercised while
the award holder is employed by Circle or any of its subsidiaries. Subject to certain provisions, a vested award may be exercised in whole or in part at any time after its date of grant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">When there are certain corporate transactions related to Circle, such as a compulsory acquisition, a general offer, a reconstruction, a merger or division of Circle, the
winding up of Circle, or the sale of Circle&#146;s business or subsidiary, the board of directors has discretion (subject to certain requirements) to allow all awards (vested or unvested) to be exercised in whole or in part. In certain
circumstances, if the board of directors exercises such discretion and the awards are not exercised, they will instead lapse. In certain corporate transactions, if Circle is acquired, all award holders may be required to release their awards in
consideration of the grant of a new award. The board of directors also has discretion (subject to certain restrictions) to determine that certain of the awards shall vest (in whole or in part) conditionally and become exercisable on the date that
Circle becomes listed on a stock exchange and any unvested awards will lapse. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">An option award can lapse when it has not been exercised after the tenth anniversary
of the date of grant (the seventh anniversary for an Irish tax resident). An option award can also lapse when the award holder ceases to be a director, an employee, or a consultant with Circle or any of its subsidiaries. An option award will lapse
when an order is made by a court (or when a resolution is passed) for the compulsory winding up of Circle. Finally, an option award lapses when the award holder becomes bankrupt or enters into a compromise with their creditors, generally except as
permitted under certain circumstances. Prior to the exercise of an option award, an award holder has no rights in respect of any Scheme Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In the event of a
reorganization, vesting conditions may be adjusted by the board of directors, subject to an auditor&#146;s confirmation that the adjustment is fair and reasonable and notice to the award holder. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The board of directors generally has the authority to amend the 2013 Scheme; <I>provided</I> that such amendment may not be made for the benefit of existing or future
award holders relating to who may be eligible to participate in the 2013 Scheme, the share reserve, and certain other matters, without prior approval by Circle in general meeting (or </P>

completion of the Redomiciliation on July 1, 2024, the board of directors of Circle Internet Group, Inc. adopted the Circle Internet Group, Inc. Share Award Plan (as amended, the &#147;2024 Plan&#148;), as the successor to the 2013 Scheme, to govern
the grant of awards with respect to shares of Class A common stock on and after the Redomiciliation, as well as for the delivery of shares underlying awards outstanding under the 2013 Scheme. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The terms of the 2024 Plan are substantially the same as those described above under the 2013 Scheme, except that references to Scheme Shares were replaced with
references to shares of Class A common stock of Circle Internet Group, Inc. (&#147;Plan Shares&#148;). In addition, the 2024 Plan is governed by Delaware, not Irish, law and therefore removes certain provisions which were applicable only under Irish
law, including those relating to a compulsory acquisition or reconstruction of the Company under Irish law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">As of the effectiveness of the Circle Internet Group,
Inc. 2025 Omnibus Incentive Plan (described under &#147;&#151;2025 Omnibus Incentive Plan&#148; below), no further equity awards will be granted under the 2024 Plan. Awards that are outstanding under the 2024 Plan as of the effectiveness of the
Omnibus Incentive Plan will remain outstanding under, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the 2024 Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The maximum number of Plan Shares which may be the

payroll deductions from his or her paycheck on each payroll date during the offering period in an amount equal to at least 1% and at most 15% of such participant&#146;s eligible compensation. Participants may decrease (but not increase) their rate
of payroll deductions during an offering period by submitting a new enrollment form which will take effect not more than 30 business days later. Participants may decrease or increase their rate of payroll deductions for future offering periods by
submitting a new enrollment form at least 10 business days before the start of the next offering period. The deduction rate selected for an offering period will remain in effect for subsequent offering periods unless the participant (i) submits a

purchase price for the option will equal the lesser of (i) 85% of the fair market value of a share on the grant date or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of a share on the purchase date. A participant&#146;s option will be exercised automatically on
the purchase date to purchase the maximum number of shares, including fractional shares, of our Class A common stock that can be purchased with the amounts in the participant&#146;s notional account. The maximum number of shares of our Class A

refer to as a related-party transaction, such related party must report the proposed related-party transaction to our audit committee. The policy calls for the proposed related-party transaction to be reviewed and, if deemed appropriate, approved by
the audit committee. In approving or rejecting such proposed transactions, the audit committee will be required to consider relevant facts and circumstances. The audit committee will approve only those transactions that, in light of known
circumstances, are deemed to be in our best interests. In the event that any member of the audit committee is not a disinterested person with respect to the related-party transaction under review, that member will be excluded from the review and
approval or rejection of such related-party transaction. If we become aware of an existing related-party transaction which has not been approved under the policy, the matter will be referred to the audit committee. The audit committee will evaluate
all options available, including ratification, revision, or termination of such transaction. In the event that management determines that it is impractical or undesirable to wait until a meeting of the audit committee to consummate a related-party
transaction, the chair of the audit committee may approve such transaction in accordance with the related-party transaction policy. Any such approval must be reported to the audit committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. </P>

standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>Critical Audit Matter </B></P>

2024, Circle Internet Financial Limited (&#147;Circle Ireland&#148;) consummated an Irish High Court-approved scheme of arrangement, pursuant to which issued ordinary shares and preferred shares in the capital of Circle Ireland were cancelled and,
in connection with such cancellation, Circle Internet Group, Inc. (&#147;Circle Group&#148;), a Delaware corporation, issued equivalent shares of capital stock (in number and class) to the then-shareholders of Circle Ireland. Upon consummation of
the scheme of arrangement, Circle Ireland became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Circle Group. The historical basis of accounting was retained as if the entities had always been combined for financial reporting purposes. The consolidated financial

obligation to return digital assets held as collateral as a debt host payable with an embedded derivative at fair value and recognizes the liability within Obligations to return digital asset collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
arrangement is a hybrid instrument, consisting of a debt host contract initially measured at fair value with an embedded forward feature based on the changes in the fair value of the underlying digital asset. Within the obligation to return digital
asset collateral is a feature indexed to the underlying digital asset that is not clearly and closely related to a debt instrument and therefore meets the definition of a derivative, which requires bifurcation. Such feature is bifurcated and
recorded at fair value through Digital assets (gains) losses and impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company designated the embedded derivatives associated with the obligation to return digital
asset collateral related to stablecoin lending as the hedging instrument in a fair value hedge relationship to hedge the fair value exposure of the corresponding digital assets. Subsequent to the fair value hedge designation, changes in the fair
value of the hedged item were recorded to Digital assets (gains) losses and impairment along with the associated changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The hedging relationship was
de-designated upon the adoption of ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2024. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">The Company enters into certain strategic investments in the form of forward contracts to

service that forms part of its single performance obligation to provide payment processing services. Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is met. The Company incurs expenses to assist in fulfilling obligations to process
payment transactions. The Company acts as the principal in providing transaction services to customers and, therefore, recognizes associated revenue and expenses on a gross basis. </P>

scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-planning</FONT> strategies in making this assessment. The Company released a portion of its foreign valuation allowance in the

million common shares of Circle Group. The warrants vest based upon the achievement of certain performance conditions for the benefit of the Company. The warrants have an exercise price of $22.71 per share and an exercise period of six years from
the grant date. The warrants are subject to certain performance conditions to be achieved within a three-year period. The fair value of the warrants, approximately $56.1 million, was measured at the time of issuance using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model using the following assumptions: the Company&#146;s estimated common share price on the grant date, a term of six years, a dividend yield of zero, volatility of 53%, and a risk-free rate of 4.43%. The warrants will be expensed as the
service conditions are achieved or over the requisite service period if and when the achievement of the performance conditions are probable. There were no distribution and transaction costs related to the warrants for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2024. None of the common shares associated with these warrants have been exercised, forfeited or expired. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>17. Redeemable convertible preferred

reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">In February
2018, one of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries acquired Poloniex, LLC (&#147;Poloniex&#148;), which owned and operated the Poloniex digital asset trading platform. In April 2018, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of
the Treasury (&#147;OFAC&#148;) served Poloniex with an administrative subpoena and a second administrative subpoena in September 2019 requesting documents and information regarding accounts opened and/or closed on the Poloniex digital asset trading
platform by persons potentially located in Iran, Cuba, Syria, North Korea, Crimea, and Sudan. In April 2023, Poloniex executed a settlement agreement with OFAC regarding its investigation and paid OFAC a settlement fee of $7.6&nbsp;million in May

Board of Directors passed resolutions terminating the engagement letters. The financial advisor has subsequently asserted that the terminations of the engagement letters are ineffective and has demanded fees and interest for various transactions.
The Company believes it has properly and effectively terminated the engagement letters with the financial advisor, and strenuously disputes the financial advisor&#146;s demand for any fees in connection with the transactions, which have all been
conducted without the financial advisor&#146;s assistance. On May 28, 2024, the financial advisor filed a lawsuit regarding the dispute. The Company does not believe that the outcome of the dispute at this point can be reasonably quantified or
estimated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B><I>Commitments and other contingencies </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Current tax rules

$99.8 million, subject to customary adjustments, consisting of $9.9 million in cash and approximately 2.9 million fully-vested common shares of Circle. The agreement also provides for the issuance of up to approximately 1.8 million additional common

Fund&#146;s financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and financial highlights, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights. Our audit also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as
of April&nbsp;30, 2024, by correspondence with custodians or counterparties; when replies were not received, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the fair value hierarchy classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The categorization of a value

obligations. The value of securities or other instruments may also be affected by various factors, including, without limitation: (i)&nbsp;the general economy; (ii)&nbsp;the overall market as well as local, regional or global political and/or social
instability; (iii)&nbsp;regulation, taxation or international tax treaties between various countries; or (iv)&nbsp;currency, interest rate and price fluctuations. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of

to honor their obligations and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties. Financial assets, which potentially expose the Fund to market, issuer and counterparty credit risks,
consist principally of financial instruments and receivables due from counterparties. The extent of the Fund&#146;s exposure to market, issuer and counterparty credit risks with respect to these financial assets is approximately their value recorded

A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the United States may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted
policy and legislative changes in the United States may also have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the United States will continue to maintain elevated
public debt levels for the foreseeable future which may constrain future economic growth. Circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the legislative &#147;debt
ceiling.&#148; Such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-payment</FONT> would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global financial system. If U.S. relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely
affect issuers that rely on the United States for trade. The United States has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, they may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the
Fund invests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B>Shareholder Purchase/Redemption Risk: </B>Shares of the Fund are held by Circle as a portion of the reserves associated with Circle&#146;s issuance
of stablecoins to customers. The assets of the Fund are expected to fluctuate depending on the creation (mining) of additional stablecoins or the redemption (burning) of such coins. Stablecoins may face periods of uncertainty resulting in the
potential for rapid requests by Circle for redemption of the Fund&#146;s shares. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund&#146;s liquidity and net assets. These large redemptions may force the Fund to sell portfolio
securities to meet redemption requests when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the Fund. In addition, large redemptions can result in the Fund&#146;s current expenses being allocated over a smaller asset base, which generally
could result in an increase in the Fund&#146;s expense ratio. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt; font-family:arial"><B>8.&#8199;Capital share transactions </B></P>

bid price or current market quotations provided by independent dealers or third-party pricing services. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but a fund may hold or
transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The pricing services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values,
including transaction data (e.g., recent representative bids and offers), market data, credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information. Certain fixed-income securities, including asset-backed and mortgage
related securities may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each tranche of the entity, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique
attributes of the tranche. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless the Manager determines such method does not represent fair value.

obligations. The value of securities or other instruments may also be affected by various factors, including, without limitation: (i)&nbsp;the general economy; (ii)&nbsp;the overall market as well as local, regional or global political and/or social
instability; (iii)&nbsp;regulation, taxation or international tax treaties between various countries; or (iv)&nbsp;currency, interest rate and price fluctuations. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of
infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments. The Fund&#146;s prospectus provides details of the risks to which the Fund is subject. </P>

economies of many nations and the global economy, and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness outbreak may result in, among other things, closed international borders, prolonged

</B>The Fund may be exposed to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that an entity may fail to or be unable to perform on its commitments related to unsettled or open transactions, including making timely interest and/or principal payments or
otherwise honoring its obligations. The Fund manages counterparty credit risk by entering into transactions only with counterparties that the Manager believes have the financial resources to honor their obligations and by monitoring the financial
stability of those counterparties. Financial assets, which potentially expose the Fund to market, issuer and counterparty credit risks, consist principally of financial instruments and receivables due from counterparties. The extent of the

exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the United States may also have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities.
Governmental agencies project that the United States will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future which may constrain future economic growth. Circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of
interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the legislative &#147;debt ceiling.&#148; Such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-payment</FONT> would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global
financial system. If U.S. relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect issuers that rely on the United States for trade. The United States has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to
continue, they may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund invests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial"><B>Large-Scale Redemption Risk: </B>Redemptions of a large
number of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund&#146;s liquidity and net assets. These redemptions may force the Fund to sell portfolio securities to meet redemption requests when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the
Fund. In addition, large redemptions can result in the Fund&#146;s current expenses being allocated over a smaller asset base, which generally could result in an increase in the Fund&#146;s expense ratio. </P>

against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed actions, suits, or proceedings in which such
person is made a party by reason of such person being or having been a director, officer, employee, or agent to the registrant. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that Section&nbsp;145 is not exclusive of other rights to which those
seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders, or disinterested directors or otherwise. Our certificate of incorporation provides for indemnification by the registrant of our directors and officers to the
fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors and executive officers to provide these directors and executive officers additional contractual
assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our certificate of incorporation and to provide additional procedural protections. There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director or executive officer of the
registrant for which indemnification is sought. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:arial">Section&nbsp;102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to provide in its certificate

officer&#146;s breach of the director&#146;s or officer&#146;s duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;a director&#146;s or officer&#146;s act or omission not in good faith or which involved intentional misconduct or a knowing
