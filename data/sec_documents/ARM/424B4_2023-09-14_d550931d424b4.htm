any of the ADSs in this offering and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the ADSs by the selling shareholder in this offering. Each ADS represents the right to receive one ordinary share, nominal value &pound;0.001 per share, and may be
evidenced by American depositary receipts (&#147;ADRs&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:9.5pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the ADSs or our
ordinary shares. The initial public offering price per ADS is $51.00. Our ADSs have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) under the symbol &#147;ARM&#148;. </P>

following the completion of this offering (or approximately 89.9% if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional ADSs from the selling shareholder). As a result of SoftBank Group&#146;s ownership, after the completion of
this offering, we will be a &#147;controlled company&#148; within the meaning of Nasdaq rules. See &#147;Management and Executive Remuneration&#151;Controlled Company Status.&#148; </P>

an aggregate of $735&nbsp;million of the ADSs offered in this offering at the initial public offering price and on the same terms and conditions as the other purchasers in this offering. Because these indications of interest are not binding
agreements or commitments to purchase, any of the Cornerstone Investors may determine to purchase more, fewer, or no ADSs in this offering, or the underwriters may determine to sell more, fewer, or no ADSs to any of the Cornerstone Investors. The
underwriters will receive the same underwriting discount on any ADSs purchased by the Cornerstone Investors as they will from the other ADSs sold to the public in this offering. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Company </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm is defining the future
of computing. Semiconductor technology has become one of the world&#146;s most critical resources, as it enables all electronic devices today. At the heart of these devices is the CPU, and Arm is the industry leader of CPUs. We architect, develop,
and license high-performance, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-cost,</FONT> and energy-efficient CPU products and related technology, on which many of the world&#146;s leading semiconductor companies and OEMs rely to develop their products. Our
energy-efficient CPUs have enabled advanced computing in greater than 99% of the world&#146;s smartphones, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and more than 250&nbsp;billion chips, cumulatively, powering everything from the tiniest of sensors to
the most powerful supercomputers. Today, Arm CPUs run the vast majority of the world&#146;s software, including the operating systems and applications for smartphones, tablets and personal computers, data centers and networking equipment, and
vehicles, as well as the embedded operating systems in devices such as smartwatches, thermostats, drones and industrial robotics. We estimate that approximately 70% of the world&#146;s population uses
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> products, and the scale of Arm&#146;s reach continues to expand, with more than 30&nbsp;billion <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> chips reported as shipped in the fiscal year ended
March&nbsp;31, 2023 alone, representing an approximately 70% increase since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today, any company can
make a modern computer chip through the unique combination of our energy-efficient CPU IP and related technologies and our unmatched ecosystem of technology partners, and do it cost effectively due to our flexible business model. Each CPU product
can be licensed to multiple companies, leading to economies of scale that allow us to charge each licensee only a fraction of what it would cost them to develop internally, while minimizing their risk and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">time-to-market.</FONT></FONT> With the complexity of CPU design increasing exponentially, over the past decade no company has successfully designed a modern CPU from scratch. We have been innovating at the forefront of
compute technology for decades and have established important relationships with the companies driving the future of computing across multiple industries. More than 260 companies reported that they had shipped Arm-based chips in the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2023, including the largest technology companies globally (such as Amazon Web Services, Inc. and Alphabet Inc.), major semiconductor chip vendors (such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Intel Corporation, MediaTek Inc., NVIDIA
Corporation, Qualcomm Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.), automotive industry incumbents, leading auto suppliers, IoT innovators, and more. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The exponential rise in smart devices in both consumer and enterprise markets has increased the demand for chips that provide more
computational capability while optimizing energy efficiency. Thirty years ago, the PC was the only computer with which most people would interact at home, work, or school. Then, mobile phones became computers in our pockets and digital TVs became
computers in our living rooms. Now, vehicles are effectively computers on wheels, and servers and networking equipment are the computers that connect all these devices and services together. Additionally, there are billions of tiny <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-cost</FONT> devices&#151;from sensors to electric motor controllers&#151;that are now functionally computers, as well. Each of these computers needs at least one CPU, and in many cases more than one. This trend has
driven the dramatic growth of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> chips over the past several years. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our creation of the Arm CPU architecture, the world&#146;s most widely used CPU
architecture, has resulted in the proliferation and evolution of computers as people know them today, advancing a paradigm of increasing compute performance coupled with industry-leading power efficiency. We enabled the mobile phone and smartphone
revolution, and through our focus on energy efficiency and our history of continuous innovation, we have enabled new categories of &#147;smart&#148; consumer electronics. Today, we are redefining what is possible in industries such as cloud
computing, automotive, and IoT. Energy efficiency is not only important for business, but it is also a critical component in achieving sustainability for our planet. This makes Arm CPU technology ideal for current and future computing applications
as the demands for compute performance are growing exponentially while the need for low power remains critical. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Every CPU has an ISA,
which defines the software instructions that can be executed by the CPU, essentially a common language for software developers to use. The ISA sets the foundation for a large library of compatible software which runs on those CPUs. As the Arm CPU is
the most popular and pervasive CPU in history, the Arm ISA is also the most popular and pervasive ISA in history. This means that Arm-based chips have a global community of software developers familiar with how to program the CPU. Chip designers
utilizing the Arm CPU can add desired functionality <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(Wi-Fi</FONT> connectivity, image processing, video processing, <I>etc.</I>) to create an SoC to meet the needs of any end market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our primary product offerings are leading CPU products that address diverse performance, power, and cost requirements. Complementary products
such as GPUs, System IP, and compute platforms are also available and enable high-performance, efficient, reliable, system-level creation for a wide range of increasingly sophisticated devices and applications. Our development tools and robust
software ecosystem have further solidified our position as the world&#146;s most widely adopted processor architecture and have created a virtuous cycle of adoption, which means that software developers write software for Arm-based devices because
it offers the biggest market for their products, and chip designers choose Arm processors because they have the broadest support of software applications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This combination of pervasiveness and ease of portability has resulted in our CPU designs having the world&#146;s richest software ecosystem,
built in partnership with the leading operating systems providers (including Google Android, Microsoft Windows and all major Linux distributions), software tools and game engine vendors (such as Electronic Arts Inc., Unity Software Inc. and Epic
Games, Inc.), and application developers. We also support a flourishing ecosystem of third-party tool vendors for embedded software and a vibrant IoT ecosystem. Open-source software plays a vital role in the success of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> chips, and we are committed to contributing to open-source software and tools to ensure our offerings are optimized for the latest technologies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the world moves increasingly towards AI- and ML-enabled computing, Arm will be central to this transition. Arm CPUs already run AI and ML
workloads in billions of devices, including smartphones, cameras, digital TVs, cars and cloud data centers. The CPU is vital in all AI systems, whether it is handling the AI workload entirely or in combination with a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-processor,</FONT> such as a GPU or an NPU. In the emerging area of large language models, generative AI and autonomous driving, there will be a heightened emphasis on the low power acceleration of these
algorithms. In our latest ISA, CPUs, and GPUs, we have added new functionality and instructions to accelerate future AI and ML algorithms. We are working with leading companies such as Alphabet, Cruise LLC, Mercedes-Benz, Meta and NVIDIA to deploy
Arm technology to run AI workloads. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm had 5,963 full-time employees across North America, Europe and Asia as of March&nbsp;31, 2023. We
are an engineering-first company, with approximately 80% of our global employees, as of March&nbsp;31, 2023, focused on research, design, and technical innovation, and we have global operations and research and development (&#147;R&amp;D&#148;)

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Established in 1990, Arm began as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple Computer, and VLSI Technology. We were publicly listed on the
London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market from 1998 until 2016, when we were taken private by SoftBank Group, our controlling shareholder. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The original joint venture set out to develop a processor that was high performance, power efficient, easy to program, and readily
scalable&#151;a goal that continues to define Arm today. Our CPUs initially gained significant traction in mobile phones in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-1990s</FONT> because our energy-efficient processors provided an appropriate level
of performance while consuming little power, which was critical for these smaller form factor devices. Over time, mobile phones, and the chips they used, became more advanced and ultimately evolved into the smartphones that are prevalent today. The
Arm CPU proved to be critical in enabling the smartphone revolution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The mobile phone was one of the first consumer electronic devices to
evolve into an intelligent, connected, digital device that needed a smart processor to run a growing library of software. With the help of Arm technology, many more devices such as televisions, watches, washing machines, cameras, factory equipment,
and others are undergoing the same revolution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Strategic Evolution </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since becoming a private company in 2016, we have made significant investments to further develop and market our products to build on our
success in powering the world&#146;s smartphones and other consumer electronic devices. We have focused in recent years on making Arm the ubiquitous provider of compute technology in all market segments by expanding into new markets, including cloud
computing, networking, automotive, and IoT, most of which have strong secular tailwinds. Our investments have resulted in a diversified business with more durable growth. </P>

indispensable to everyday life. In today&#146;s technology-driven world, semiconductors are the enablers of the devices and infrastructure that facilitate virtually everything people do, such as making a phone call, sending an email, storing files
in the cloud, streaming videos, or traveling by car, train, or plane. Almost all of the products and services people use every day rely on semiconductors. Manufacturing, logistics, city infrastructure, and building management also increasingly build
their processes and services around semiconductor-enabled devices. As consumers and enterprises continue to demand more from their devices, the pervasiveness of high-performance and energy-efficient semiconductors will continue to expand. We believe
there are several key trends driving the growth and evolution of the semiconductor industry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Proliferation of Smart, Connected Devices Supporting

as smartphones, wearables, PCs, tablets, and other electronic devices. Even everyday products like washing machines, thermostats, and utility meters are becoming more advanced. According to Deloitte&#146;s 2022 Connectivity and Mobile Trends Survey,
the average U.S. household had 22 connected devices in 2022, doubling from 11 devices in 2019. The market trend to make nearly all products smart and connected is not just limited to consumer electronics, but is also driving a wave of innovation
across a broad range of end markets and use cases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Increased Need for High-Performance, Power-Efficient Compute </I></B></P>

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">high-performance</FONT> compute capabilities. To address increasingly complex workloads, a key approach has been to increase the speed of a CPU and expand the number of processor cores per chip. For instance, the
number of cores per &#147;high end&#148; Arm-based chip has increased from 8 in 2016 to 192 in 2023. Solely running an existing chip faster may deliver more compute performance, but increasing performance results in higher energy

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resources required to develop leading-edge products are significant and continue to increase exponentially as manufacturing process nodes
shrink. According to the International Business Strategy, Inc. (&#147;IBS&#148;), IC design costs were approximately $249&nbsp;million for a 7nm chip and approximately $725&nbsp;million for a 2nm chip, representing approximately a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">three-times</FONT> increase in design cost as compared to a 7nm chip. Design partners play an increasingly valuable role in the chip design process by providing specialized capabilities and expertise that enable
semiconductor suppliers to focus on their core product differentiation, while keeping pace with market innovation. Design partners facilitate innovation and enhance customers&#146; competitive positioning by reducing the complexity, risk, and cost
of a significant part of the development cycle. For example, to design a 2nm chip, IBS estimates that the software development, verification, and IP qualification is 71% of the overall cost. In addition, design partners, like Arm, that can
demonstrate a deep understanding of their customers&#146; workloads are better positioned to integrate themselves into their customers&#146; workflows, further expanding their value proposition over time. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many OEMs today utilize <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;off-the-shelf,&#148;</FONT></FONT> or
&#147;merchant,&#148; semiconductors when building their product offerings. However, this approach can introduce compromises. For example, an OEM may use a chip that includes features that are irrelevant for its use case, at the expense of
performance and cost efficiency. Similarly, an OEM may need a chip that incorporates features not otherwise available from a merchant supplier. As a result, leading OEMs are increasingly looking to build custom chips in-house that deliver greater
performance and greater efficiency at an equal or better price for a particular use case. The success of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> products such as Amazon AWS&#146; Graviton, deployed across Amazon AWS data centers globally,
have demonstrated the opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage through this approach. For example, Amazon AWS claims that Graviton delivers up to 40% better price performance over comparable x86-based systems. This trend of
increasing use of in-house developed solutions has significantly expanded the opportunity for Arm. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Solution </B></P>

processors, including the integration of multiple IP technologies into a subsystem and additional information to assist in fabrication. More recently, we have invested in a holistic, solution-focused approach to design, expanding beyond individual
design IP elements to providing a more complete system. By delivering SoC solutions optimized for specific use cases, we can ensure that the entire system works together seamlessly to provide maximum performance and efficiency. At the same time, by
designing an increasingly greater portion of the overall chip design, we are further reducing incremental development investment and risk borne by our customers while also enabling us to capture more value per device. </P></TD></TR></TABLE>

capability within a power budget and, as such, can be used in multiple different devices that have similar compute requirements. An Arm customer who may have designed a processor for one application may, in the future, find additional applications
that can utilize this technology. Consequently, Arm products may be used in new products for new end markets for many years or, in some cases, decades. For example, a processor originally licensed to go into a chip for a smartphone can also be used
in a chip for a tablet, digital TV, or smart speaker. We expect this trend to continue with the growing proliferation of devices and use cases. </P></TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

April&nbsp;9, 2018, with the company number 11299879. Arm Holdings Limited <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-registered</FONT> as a public limited company under the laws of England and Wales on September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2023 and changed its name to
Arm Holdings plc. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm Limited was incorporated as a private limited company with the legal name Widelogic Limited under the laws of
England and Wales on November&nbsp;12, 1990 with the company number 02557590. On December&nbsp;3, 1990, Widelogic Limited changed its company name to Advanced RISC Machines Limited, and, on May&nbsp;21, 1998, it changed its company name to Arm
Limited (at which time it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782). Our business was initially operated through Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782, which was previously an independent
publicly traded corporation until its acquisition in September 2016 by SoftBank Group. On March&nbsp;19, 2018, as a part of a reorganization, Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-registered</FONT> as
a private limited company and was renamed SVF HoldCo (UK) Limited, which became a subsidiary of SoftBank Vision Fund L.P. (&#147;SoftBank Vision Fund&#148;), which retained an approximate 25% interest in our company with the remainder beneficially
held by SoftBank Group. In August 2023, a subsidiary of SoftBank Group acquired substantially all of SoftBank Vision Fund&#146;s interest in Arm Limited at a purchase price of approximately $16.1 billion, with the associated payments to be made in
installments over a two-year period. The purchase price was established by reference to the terms of a prior contractual arrangement between the parties. Accordingly, prior to this offering, SoftBank Group beneficially owns substantially all of our
outstanding shares. Our registered office is 110 Fulbourn Road, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB1 9NJ, U.K., and the telephone number at that office is +44 (1223) 400 400. </P>

same class and in the same proportions as their previous shareholdings in Arm Limited. As a result, Arm Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arm Holdings Limited. On September&nbsp;1, 2023, Arm Holdings Limited

information in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#148; before deciding whether to invest in
our ADSs. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our ADSs could decline and you may lose
all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially impair our business operations. </I></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Demand for our products and services is largely dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries, which are volatile, intensely
competitive and generally characterized by declining ASPs over the life of a generation of chips. The effect of these price decreases is compounded by the fact that our royalty rates generally decrease as the volume of sales increases, subject to an
agreed minimum royalty per chip. Additionally, demand for our products and services could decrease if growth in the semiconductor or electronics industries slows or declines. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The revenue we generate from licensing activities is also largely dependent on the rate at which systems companies develop and adopt new
product generations, which, in turn, is affected by the level of demand for their ICs and other products. Decreasing demand from systems companies for chips based on our products would directly and adversely affect the amount of royalties we
receive. As a result of our dependence on demand from systems companies, we are subject to several risks affecting these systems companies, any one of which may influence the success or failure of a particular systems company. These risks include,

increasing design and manufacturing costs. Many of our customers utilize third-party vendors for EDA tools and also outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. We work closely with major EDA vendors and foundries to ensure
that our products are compatible with their design tools and manufacturing processes. However, if we fail to optimize our products for use with major EDA vendors&#146; tools and foundries&#146; manufacturing processes, or if our access to such tools

open-source technologies, including the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</FONT> architecture. Many of our customers are also major supporters of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</FONT> architecture and related technologies. If <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V-related</FONT> technology continues to be developed and market support for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</FONT> increases, our customers may choose to utilize this free, open-source architecture instead of
our products. Additionally, many of our direct and indirect competitors, including some of our semiconductor customers, are major corporations with substantially greater technical, financial and marketing resources and name recognition than we have.
Some of these competitors have a much larger application software base and a much larger installed customer base than we do, and there can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise, and marketing, distribution
and support capabilities to compete successfully with them in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In markets where we are established already and new markets we
have entered or intend to enter, our primary competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, support or other resources and capabilities, greater brand recognition, lower labor and development costs, different regulatory
restrictions or a larger customer base than we do. In these markets, we may have to invest substantial resources into developing an ecosystem of software and tools to create a competitive ecosystem that allows us to compete with alternative
architectures such as x86 and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V,</FONT> which have business models that are different from ours and may be more attractive to some of our customers. Our competitors may devote greater resources to the
development, promotion and sale of products and services, they may offer lower pricing and different customer engagement models, and their performance, features and product quality may be more desirable than those of our company. Our current and
potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources or strengthen their positions within these markets, or may be subject to more favorable regulatory
regimes. For example, in August 2023, a group of our customers and </P>

other competitors announced a joint venture aimed at accelerating the adoption of RISC-V. Although the development of alternative architectures and technology is a time-intensive process, if our
competitors establish cooperative relationships or consolidate with each other or third parties, such as the recently announced joint venture focused on RISC-V, they may have additional resources that would allow them to more quickly develop
architectures and other technology that directly compete with our products. Such cooperative relationships or consolidations may also allow competitors to anticipate or respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing
opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in revenue and profitability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some semiconductor companies have developed their own proprietary architecture for specific markets or applications. These companies may
utilize their proprietary architecture to penetrate markets where we are currently the architecture of choice, or where our products may be utilized, making it more difficult for us to penetrate such markets in the future. Some semiconductor
companies have proprietary architectures in applications, including, but not limited to, automotive, data center equipment, networking equipment, electronic storage, microcontrollers, smart sensors, servers and wireless communications. These
companies may be significantly entrenched in their markets. If these companies are successful in displacing our products, or if we are unable to penetrate or grow our market share in these areas, licensing opportunities and potential royalties could
be harmed, negatively affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our development systems tools business also faces significant competition from both the open-source community and third-party tools and software
suppliers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While our customers likely would incur significant costs in switching to competitors&#146; architecture, our competitors
(including new market entrants) may offer greater incentives to customers through rebates, marketing funds, similar programs and other commercial arrangements to induce them to use their architecture in lieu of our products. Additionally, our
competitors with multiple products or services may bundle their architecture, products and services to offer a broader product portfolio (which may include products or services we do not offer), which may make it difficult for us to gain or maintain
market share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Physical IP business also faces significant competition from third parties, including the internal design groups of IC
manufacturers that have expanded their internal design capabilities and portfolio of Physical IP components. Physical IP components developed internally by our customers may be designed specifically to utilize the unique qualities of their own
manufacturing processes, and may benefit from capacity, informational, cost and technical advantages relative to our Physical IP components, and we may be unable to compete effectively with such internal design groups. </P>

selling additional products to our existing customers and increasing the price we charge to existing customers represent our principal opportunities to increase revenue (particularly licensing revenue). We generate a significant portion of our
revenues from customers who incorporate our products into chips used in smartphones, consumer electronics and other embedded chips. If growth in these markets declines (including in the smartphone market, in which growth has declined in recent
years), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected, and we would become more dependent on new growth areas to increase revenue and improve our financial condition. We are currently focused on
growing our business in key areas such as infrastructure, automotive, IoT, AI and 5G. Numerous factors, however, may impede our ability to grow our business in these key areas, add new customers and sell additional products to our existing

largest customer individually, Arm China, accounted for approximately 24% and 18% of our total revenue, respectively, during those fiscal years. As a result of this customer concentration, we are particularly susceptible to adverse developments
affecting our key customers and their respective businesses, including industry downturns, decreased demand for their products, increased competition, changes in trade protection and other government policies, financial hardship and changes in their
business model, purchasing behavior and strategic priorities, among other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, developments in our key customers&#146; respective businesses that adversely affect their ability to satisfy
their payment obligations to us or result in their determination not to continue or expand their use of our products would have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations to a greater extent than if our customer base were
more diversified. Our customer concentration also has afforded certain customers significant bargaining power, which has, in some cases, resulted in pricing or other contractual terms that are less favorable to us. For example, subject to certain
limitations, certain of our contracts with key customers contain provisions allowing such customers to obtain licenses to our latest products as soon as they are made available to any other customer. If we were to lose one or more of our key
customers or if our business with one or more key customers were to decrease significantly, whether as a result of external impacts on the business of those customers, or, for example, as a result of disputes with such customers with respect to

new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These new markets may not grow as projected or at all,
and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. Due to the interdependence of various components in the products in which our architecture and our competitors&#146; architectures are used, customers are unlikely to change to another
product, once adopted, until the next generation of a technology. As a result, even if our products are superior to alternative offerings, it may be difficult for our products to displace alternative technologies as a result of high switching costs
to change to our products, including the need for potential customers to make significant investments in additional training and development tools and to convert software for existing devices. Additionally, to the extent our competitors have done
business with prospective customers for a long period of time and have established relationships, our competitors may have information regarding future trends and requirements of such prospective customers that may not be available to us. If any of

achieve. As a result of these rapid technological changes and others currently unknown, the future market for our products is difficult to predict. These risks are further exacerbated by the fact that our products often use a common architecture for

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fact that Arm China operates independently of us exposes us to significant risks. Arm
China&#146;s value to us as a customer is dependent on Arm China&#146;s business results, which are, in turn, subject to substantial risks that are outside of our control. For example, Arm China may not commit the necessary resources to market and
sell our products to PRC end-users of our semiconductor IP products. Arm China also may fail to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements applicable to its business, which could limit its ability to market or sell our products in the PRC. In
addition, Arm China may fail to attract, train, retain and motivate highly skilled managerial and technical personnel necessary for its business. Arm China may also have difficulties accessing funding or enforcing contractual relationships. The
realization of these or other risks related to Arm China&#146;s business may have a material adverse effect on Arm China&#146;s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and, by extension, our own. Since Arm China operates
independently of us and we do not control Arm China, our ability to take measures to address the various risks facing Arm China is limited. If any of such risks related to Arm China&#146;s business are realized, our revenue could materially decline
and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the IPLA with Arm China, Arm China&#146;s payments due to us
are determined based on the financial information that Arm China provides to us. Accordingly, similar to our other royalty customers, we are dependent on Arm China providing us with reliable and timely information. We perform various procedures to
assess the reasonableness of Arm China&#146;s data, and the IPLA includes rights for us to audit Arm China&#146;s activities to ensure compliance with the IPLA. In the past, we have had issues obtaining timely and accurate information from Arm
China. We believe the underlying problems causing our past inability to obtain such information have been resolved, but we can provide no assurances that our access to Arm China&#146;s records will not be inhibited again in the future. If Arm China
does not provide us with timely and accurate information, our revenue could materially decline and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We are also dependent on Arm China paying us the amounts that it owes us in a timely
manner and in full. In the past, we have received late payments from Arm China and have had to expend company resources to obtain payments from Arm China. Although these historical issues did not have a material impact on our operations, any future
failure to pay us the amounts we are owed under the IPLA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, Arm China has possession of or access to certain material IP and customer data pursuant to the IPLA and other commercial
arrangements with us. Although Arm China is contractually obligated to protect this IP and data, we are limited in our ability to monitor or influence the manner in which Arm China protects our IP and data from theft, loss or misuse. Arm China
operates its own separate information technology infrastructure. Aside from customary audit rights and protections under the IPLA, we are therefore unable to independently assure the adequacy of protections that Arm China implements with respect to
its possession and/or access to our IP and data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, under the IPLA with Arm China, we are contractually obligated to indemnify
both Arm China and its PRC customers that sublicense our IP in the event that either Arm China or such customers incur damages or costs in lawsuits, administrative proceedings or similar actions based upon a claim that our IP infringes the IP of a
third party. The liability that we incur to Arm China or its PRC customers under such provisions could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, since April 2022, Allen Wu, the former chief executive officer of Arm China, and certain entities under his effective control,
have initiated several lawsuits in the courts of the PRC seeking to challenge certain aspects of Arm China&#146;s corporate governance and the actions of Arm China&#146;s board of directors. To date, all cases that have been resolved at the trial
court level have been resolved favorably to Arm China but are subject to appeal. In the event that certain of these cases were to be decided adversely to Arm China, it could result in further changes to Arm China&#146;s corporate governance and
management structure, which could reduce SoftBank Group&#146;s ability to conduct effective oversight of Arm China and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </P>

semiconductor companies and OEMs may increasingly develop their own technology and use such technology in their devices, or use our competitors&#146; technology in their devices. Specifically, the PRC government&#146;s 14th Five-Year Plan and
related initiatives have identified the development of globally competitive PRC companies in &#147;core technologies&#148; such as semiconductors as a key policy focus. As part of a government-wide effort to encourage investment and development of

Architect, and other key employees. Competition for highly skilled personnel, and particularly engineers, can be intense. Other companies may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be
difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. We experience voluntary attrition on an ongoing basis, and we reduced overall headcount as part of a restructuring that was completed in June 2022 to
address duplicative work functions and deprioritize certain initiatives within the Company. Circumstances may require a further reduction in the overall size of our organization, which may present challenges in managing and growing our business. If
we lose the services of any of our senior management personnel, other key personnel or a significant number of our engineers or sales and marketing personnel, our development efforts or business relationships could be disrupted, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our future success significantly depends on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite educational
background and industry experience. Competition for such qualified engineers is intense and the cost of attracting and retaining qualified employees may increase without a corresponding increase in the prices we charge our customers, which could
materially and adversely affect our profitability. In certain geographic regions, there is also intense competition for sales and marketing personnel, which may adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets. Particularly, changes to the
U.K.&#146;s border and immigration policy could occur as a result of Brexit, potentially affecting our ability to recruit and retain employees from outside the U.K. If we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to fulfill
our current or future needs, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. </P>

offer significant discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products, we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully. Any such changes
would likely reduce our profit margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any substantial changes to our other commercial arrangements with our customers or our
business model could cause revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the commercial arrangements or business model. Changes to our business model could also necessitate changes in our product mix,
which could cause revenues or profitability to decline, particularly if such changes in our product mix result in an increased reliance on lower margin offerings. If we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in sales volume or
by reducing our costs, then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </P>

essential to the practice of those standards for little or no cost, or otherwise on RAND terms, which could limit our control over the use of these patents and products. If we fail to limit to whom we license our patents or products, or fail to
limit the terms of any such licenses, we may be required to license our patents or other IP to others in the future, which could limit the effectiveness of our patents against competitors. In these situations, the royalty rates we charge could be
limited for these products, and we may be unable to limit to whom we license such products or to restrict many terms of the license. As a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or
protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. We may in the future be subject to claims that our licensing of industry standard technologies may not conform to the requirements of the standards-setting

open-source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use
to protect our IP. In the event that the copyright holder of any open-source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code

licensing model, for example, the payment by customers of fees under this new licensing model will be collected based on the negotiated annual fee leading to a deferral of upfront license fees that we have historically received under a TLA. This

to engage us, that we would be successful in designing chips for our customers&#146; intended use cases. Customizing our chip designs for one or more customers may necessitate substantial investments in technology and human capital, and it could
take several years for us to realize any associated benefits, if ever. This may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could hurt our ability to grow our business. In addition, any efforts to design custom chips may require
substantial time and attention from our executives, engineers and other employees, which could distract them from operating our business, and divert attention and resources away from our core business. </P>

agreements to which we are subject from time to time may also contractually restrict our ability to make acquisitions and investments in some circumstances. In addition, applicable antitrust, national security (including with respect to the U.K.
National Security and Investment Act 2021 or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) or other laws or regulations may limit our ability to acquire, invest in or integrate targets, or may force us to divest an acquired business or
impose restrictions on an investment. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete or successfully integrate acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages

business may require us to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to address the retention, attraction, training, motivation and management of employees across a broader geographical and operational footprint. Such growth could
strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel, implement systems, policies, benefits and compliance

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our exposure to different legal jurisdictions also may impact our ability to exercise our contractual and other rights around IP in such
jurisdictions, in particular in countries whose laws regarding the protection of IP are less rigorous or more difficult to enforce than in the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union. In jurisdictions where effective IP protection is unavailable or
limited, our IP rights may be vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure, infringement, misappropriation or other violation by employees, third-party partners, suppliers, customers and other entities or individuals, even though our customers and partners
are contractually restricted from using our IP outside of the agreed-upon licensing arrangements. Policing unauthorized use of our IP is difficult and expensive, and we may not be able, or may lack the resources, to prevent infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of our IP rights, including increased difficulty as a foreign entity in certain international locations, particularly outside the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union. In addition, our ability to monitor and
control theft, misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union, as the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our proprietary and
confidential information as do the laws of the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union. Moreover, because we deliver our products to our customers in a source form, we have limited ability to trace the source of misappropriation of our IP and there
are limited technological barriers (e.g., remote authorization requirements) we can put in place to protect our products from use by unauthorized parties. Additionally, theft of our IP or proprietary business information (including our trade
secrets) could require substantial expenditures and resources to remedy. If we, our employees or our third-party partners, consultants, contractors, vendors or service providers were to suffer an attack or breach, for example, that results in the
unauthorized access to, or use, theft, disclosure, misappropriation or sale of, our IP by any unauthorized third parties, we may have to notify consumers, partners or governmental authorities, and may be subject to investigations, civil penalties,
administrative and enforcement actions and litigation, any of which could be costly and distracting or otherwise harm our business and reputation. </P>

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">knock-off,</FONT> grey-market, infringing or otherwise unauthorized goods). Specifically, third parties may distribute, license and sell counterfeit or grey-market versions of our products, which may be inferior or pose
safety risks and could confuse consumers or customers, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future or otherwise damage our reputation. The presence of counterfeit versions of our products and technology in the market
could also dilute the value of our brands, force us and our customers to compete with heavily discounted products and technology, cause us to be in breach of contract (including license agreements), impact our compliance with distribution and
competition laws in jurisdictions including the U.K., the U.S., the European Union and the PRC, or otherwise have a negative impact on our reputation and business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Further, we may not be able

and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our IP
rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our IP rights. In addition, counterparties in litigation may have greater resources that they can dedicate to litigation-related matters
than we can. Moreover, litigation against current or former customers and partners may adversely impact existing relationships. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our IP

our business, which may include claims with respect to commercial, product liability, IP, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, antitrust, breach of contract, labor and employment, whistleblower, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. We are
involved in pending litigation, including, but not limited to, a lawsuit with Qualcomm Inc. and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (together &#147;Qualcomm&#148;) and Nuvia, Inc. (&#147;Nuvia&#148;). In addition, our products are involved in pending

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;31, 2022, we sued Qualcomm and Nuvia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, on the basis that Qualcomm and
Nuvia: (i)&nbsp;breached the termination provisions of Nuvia&#146;s Architecture License Agreement (the &#147;Nuvia ALA&#148;) with us by failing to destroy technology Nuvia developed under the Nuvia ALA, which we terminated in March 2022 based on
Nuvia&#146;s failure to obtain our consent to the assignment of the Nuvia ALA to Qualcomm; and (ii)&nbsp;will infringe our trademarks when Qualcomm uses them in connection with the Nuvia technology subject to destruction under the Nuvia ALA. Our
complaint seeks, among other things, specific performance of the Nuvia ALA termination provisions to require Qualcomm and Nuvia to stop using and to destroy the relevant Nuvia technology and to stop their improper use of our trademarks with their
related products. We also seek declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and damages relating to Qualcomm&#146;s and Nuvia&#146;s breach of contract and infringement of our trademarks in connection with the relevant Nuvia technology. Qualcomm has
responded and brought a counterclaim against us seeking a declaratory judgment that after Qualcomm&#146;s acquisition of Nuvia, Qualcomm&#146;s proposed products are fully licensed from us under its separate license agreements with us and that it
has complied with its contractual obligations to us and Nuvia did not breach the Nuvia ALA. We and Qualcomm can amend our respective claims to seek additional or different relief as the proceedings progress. We can provide no assurances regarding
the outcome of the litigation or how the litigation will affect our relationship with Qualcomm, which is currently a major customer of ours and accounted for 11% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. This case is currently
in the discovery phase, with trial set for September 2024, and will likely require significant legal expenditures going forward. It may also require substantial time and attention from our executives or employees, which could distract them from
operating our business. In addition, our involvement in such litigation could cause us to incur significant reputational damage in the industry, in our relationship with Qualcomm or in our relationship with other

is merit to such claims. Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected by an

have been, and are likely to continue to be, affected by changes in the relative value of the various currencies in which our revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are denominated, and especially the U.S. dollar to British pound sterling exchange
rate, as well as the exchange rates to the euro and Indian rupee, may have a material impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition. To manage our exposure, we may engage in the use of financial derivatives or currency hedging
transactions, although such activities may not cover all of our exposure, may be costly and may also expose us to counterparty risk. Despite hedging and other mitigating techniques implemented by us, fluctuations in exchange rates have in the past

Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this &#147;Risk Factors&#148; section, could significantly harm our brand and reputation. Our
reputation can be impacted by catastrophic events, incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct, product quality, security, or safety issues, allegations of legal noncompliance, internal control failures, corporate governance issues, data
breaches, workplace safety incidents, environmental issues, the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications, including AI and ML or military applications that present ethical, regulatory, or other issues, marketing practices, media
statements, the conduct of our suppliers or representatives, and other issues, incidents, or statements that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate
crises and other threats to our brand and reputation, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our brand and reputation, which could result in loss of trust from our customers, third-party partners and employees and could lead
to an increase in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our brand and
reputation may be damaged by the actions of third parties that are imputed to us. For example, although Arm China operates independently of us, Arm China uses our trademarks in its marketing and branding. To the extent that Arm China&#146;s actions
are imputed to us due to Arm China&#146;s use of our trademarks, our own brand and reputation may suffer significant damage. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Damage to
our brand and reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business, operating environment and the trading price of our securities. Damage to our reputation may also make us less attractive to current and prospective
employees relative to our competitors, particularly given the intensely competitive market for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our brand and reputation may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. The heightened competitive

a negative impact on the trading price of our securities and our access to and costs of capital. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory

including the U.S., the PRC, India, Canada, South Africa and Europe. We may in the future expand our operations either within these jurisdictions or to new jurisdictions. Risks associated with these international operations include exposure to
political, economic and financial conditions and expected and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory environments. We may, from time to time, enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or similar business relationships with entities in
foreign jurisdictions, including governmental or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">quasi-governmental</FONT> entities, pursuant to which we may be required to license or transfer certain of our IP rights to such entities. Such relationships could

portfolio. For instance, the U.S. has published significant changes to export sanctions regulations with respect to Russia and the PRC, and we anticipate additional changes to such regulations in
the future. In October 2022, the U.S. Government implemented export controls on advanced computing chips, computer commodities that contain such chips, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving
items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-uses.</FONT> The new controls expand the scope of items subject to license requirements for certain entities on the U.S. Government&#146;s Entity List (as
defined below). As a result, our freedom to license our products to designated countries or entities could be reduced, and our commercial relationships could be further harmed by limiting the ability of certain of our customers and partners from
freely shipping chips and end products incorporating certain of our products. For instance, given U.S. and U.K. trade and national security policies regarding exports of technology with potential military uses, it is unlikely that we would be able
to obtain a U.S. or U.K. export license for certain high performance compute cores in the Neoverse series processor family. This and any similar limitations could also reduce our revenues and cause significant uncertainty in our products roadmap,

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, trade relations between countries where we do business or where our customers have end customers has recently been volatile. For
example, the U.S. Government has imposed export sanctions on certain trading partners and entities which impact the cross-border transfer of technology and software products and announced new licensing requirements which impact exports of some of
our customer&#146;s ICs and certain related items. These measures may increase costs and/or reduce distribution in key markets. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to
increase prices to adequately address any restrictions, it could result in lower margins on products sold or fewer products sold, which would reduce royalties. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and could result in more, U.S. trading
partners adopting responsive trade policies, including imposition of increased tariffs, quotas or duties, or imposition of technology or financial sanctions or controls, making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those
countries. The implementation of a border tax, tariff or higher customs duties on products of our customers or their end customers manufactured outside of the U.S. or components that our customers or their end customers import into the U.S., or any
potential corresponding actions by other countries in which our customers or their end customers do business, could negatively impact our financial performance and/or ability to protect our IP. Such developments could also result in a decrease in
the demand for or injunctions on the products of our customers or their end customers, which would reduce our royalties and have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability and thereby on or business, results of operations, financial

regarding the collection, control, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of personal data. Failure to comply with the GDPR or the U.K. GDPR can result in significant fines and other liability, including fines of up to &#128;20&nbsp;million
(or &pound;17.5&nbsp;million under the U.K. GDPR) or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. European data protection authorities have already imposed fines for GDPR violations up to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of euros. While
the U.K. GDPR currently imposes substantially the same obligations as the GDPR, the U.K. GDPR will not automatically incorporate changes to the GDPR going forward (which would need to be specifically incorporated by the U.K. government), which
creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty. For example, in 2021, the European Commission announced an adequacy decision concluding that the U.K. ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides
some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the European Economic Area (&#147;EEA&#148;) to the U.K. This adequacy determination will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission renews or extends it
and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot predict how the U.K. GDPR and other U.K. privacy and data protection laws, regulations or rules may develop, including as compared to the GDPR, nor can we predict the effects of divergent laws
and related guidance. Moreover, the U.K. government has publicly announced plans to reform the U.K. GDPR in ways that, if formalized, are likely to create a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty, along with the potential for
increased compliance costs and risks for affected business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing
companies to transfer personal information from the EEA to outside the EEA (including the U.S.) could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new
agreements that support cross-border data transfers. While the European Commission adopted on July 10, 2023 an adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, enabling U.S. companies who certify to the

that provide promises and assurances about privacy and data protection can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Any concerns about our privacy and

impact our ability or our customers&#146; ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our products, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. </P>

Markets Inc., Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., Natixis Securities
Americas LLC, Santander US Capital Markets LLC and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. or their affiliates), to be secured by our outstanding ordinary shares and to be funded following, or substantially concurrently with, the closing of this
offering, but in any event after the Existing SoftBank Group Facility is repaid (the &#147;New SoftBank Group Facility&#148;). We have no material obligations with respect to the New SoftBank Group Facility. The New SoftBank Group Facility will
initially be secured by a pledge of 769,029,000 of our ordinary shares representing a 75.01% equity interest in us (before giving effect to the issuance of ordinary shares issuable upon the completion of this offering in connection with the vesting
of RSUs and Executive Awards) pursuant to certain exceptions to the lock-up agreements. See &#147;Ordinary Shares and ADSs Eligible for Future Sale&#151;Lock-up Agreements.&#148; We face various risks in connection with such transactions. The New
SoftBank Group Facility contains, and such other financing transactions may contain, provisions that, subject to their terms, require prepayment if certain events or circumstances occur, including certain change of control transactions or in the
event the trading price of our ADSs declines below certain thresholds. From time to time, subject to certain requirements under the terms of the New SoftBank Group Facility and any other such financing transactions, SoftBank Group or the relevant
subsidiary of SoftBank Group, as applicable, may consider it advisable to sell shares in order to finance the prepayment or repayment of such financings, which number of shares may, individually or in the aggregate, be significant. In addition, in
connection with the New SoftBank Group Facility and any other such financings, if the price of our ADSs declines to certain levels, absent a repayment of the applicable financing, SoftBank Group may be required to provide additional collateral. For
instance, the New SoftBank Group Facility could be subject to a &#147;margin call&#148; by the providers of the facility if, among other events, the loan-to-value (LTV) exceeds a certain threshold. In the event of such a margin call, the relevant
subsidiary of SoftBank Group would need to deposit additional funds with the providers of the facility and may decide to sell some of the pledged shares to provide such funds. In the case of non-payment at maturity or another event of default, the
providers of the New SoftBank Group Facility and any other such financing may, in addition to other remedies, exercise their rights to foreclose on and sell or cause the sale of our shares that may be pledged as collateral. The foreclosure on our
shares that are initially pledged as collateral for the New SoftBank Group Facility could cause a change of control of us and if such shares are sold, such sales could cause the trading price of our ADSs to decline. Sales of our securities in
connection with the New SoftBank Group Facility and any other such financing transactions, whether by SoftBank Group or upon enforcement against collateral, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, access to
equity capital and the trading price of our ADSs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If SoftBank Group sells a controlling equity interest in our company to a third party in a

of the U.S. or (b)(i) a majority of our executive officers or directors cannot be U.S. citizens or residents, (ii)&nbsp;more than 50% of our assets must be located outside the U.S. and (iii)&nbsp;our business must be administered principally outside

comply with the Exchange Act reporting and other requirements applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, which are more detailed and extensive than the requirements for foreign private issuers. We may also be required to make changes in our corporate

significantly higher than the cost we would incur as a foreign private issuer. As a result, we expect that a loss of foreign private issuer status would increase our legal and financial compliance costs and is likely to make some activities highly
time-consuming and costly. We also expect that if we were required to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, it would make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance,

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash, except that such rights do not
apply to the allotment of equity securities that would, apart from any renunciation or assignment of the right to their allotment, be held under or allotted or transferred pursuant to an employees&#146; share scheme. However, it is possible for the
articles of association, or for shareholders to pass a special resolution at a general meeting, being a resolution passed by at least 75% of the votes cast, to disapply preemptive rights. Such a disapplication of preemptive rights may be for a
maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the articles of association, if the disapplication is contained in the articles of association, or from the date of the shareholder special resolution, if the disapplication is by
shareholder special resolution, but not longer than the duration of the authority to allot shares to which the disapplication relates. In either case, this disapplication would need to be renewed by our shareholders upon its expiration (i.e., at
least every five years). We have obtained authority from our shareholders to disapply preemptive rights ending August&nbsp;25, 2028, which disapplication will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years), but may be sought
more frequently for additional five-year terms (or for any shorter period). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">English law also generally prohibits a public company from

duty reserve tax (&#147;SDRT&#148;) are expected to arise on either the transfer of ADSs into DTC&#146;s facilities or on subsequent transfers of book-entry interests in ADSs entirely within DTC&#146;s facilities. Similarly, on the basis of current
law and HMRC practice, a transfer of title in the ADSs from within the DTC clearance system to a purchaser out of the DTC clearance system and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC clearance system should not attract a charge
to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you choose to withdraw the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs (in accordance with the deposit agreement,

of the ordinary shares into the ADR program (at the rates specified below). Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to hold your ADSs (representing ordinary shares) in book-entry form through the facilities of DTC. </P>

in the books of the depositary for the ADSs to be issued, the transferor will also be required to put funds in the depositary to settle any resultant liability to stamp duty (or SDRT), which will be charged at a rate of 1.5% of the value of the
ADSs. We have received confirmation from HMRC that, in respect of the transactions contemplated by, and put in place as part of, this offering, no charge to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT should arise. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot assure you that the current legislation and/or HMRC guidance will not change. In particular, certain rights derived from European
Union law currently recognized in U.K. domestic law will cease to be so following December 31, 2023 as a result of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023, absent the exercise of a regulation-making power to restate or reproduce
specific rights in U.K. domestic law. Rights derived from European Union law, of this type, would therefore cease to restrict the application of the rules providing for the 1.5% U.K. stamp duty or SDRT charge. There has been no indication that these
European Union law rights will be restated or reproduced in U.K. domestic law before December 31, 2023. Accordingly, future issues or transfers of our ordinary shares to, or appropriations of our ordinary shares by, depositary receipt systems after
December 31, 2023 may be subject to 1.5% U.K. stamp duty or SDRT. The HMRC confirmation referred to above does not extend to such future transactions. </P>

of the DTC clearance system and/or any subsequent transfers of ADSs that occur entirely outside (or inside) the DTC clearance system, will attract a charge to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT. Any such U.K. stamp duty or SDRT will be chargeable at a rate of
0.5% (or potentially 1.5% in certain circumstances) of any consideration, which is normally payable by the transferee. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document, if any, stamped by HMRC) before the transfer can be registered in
the books of the depositary and, if relevant, ADSs issued to a nominee for DTC and corresponding book-entry interests credited in the facilities of DTC. </P>

determined by negotiations among the lead underwriters, the selling shareholder and us. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were our future prospects and the prospects of our industry in general, our
revenue, net income and certain other financial and operating information in recent periods, and the market prices of securities and certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in activities similar to ours. However, there can
be no assurance that, following the completion of this offering, the ADSs will trade at a price equal to or greater than the public offering price. </P>

Group acquired substantially all of SoftBank Vision Fund&#146;s approximately 25% interest in Arm Limited at a purchase price of approximately $16.1 billion, with the associated payments to be made in installments over a two-year period. The
purchase price for this transaction was established by reference to the terms of a prior contractual arrangement between the parties. Moreover, the transfer was part of a larger transaction that also involved transfers of certain other entities from
SoftBank Vision Fund to SoftBank Group. The consideration for such transfers is not included in the purchase price paid for the shares of Arm Limited. In light of the foregoing, investors are cautioned that the purchase price paid in respect of the
Arm Limited shares may not be indicative of, and is not intended to reflect, expectations regarding the trading price of our ADSs following the completion of this offering. </P>

pursuant to which they may demand that we register the resale of its ordinary shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares (including ADSs) (&#147;Registrable Securities&#148;) and, under certain circumstances, will also
have customary &#147;piggyback&#148; registration rights for its Registrable Securities in connection with certain registrations of securities by us. In addition, SoftBank Group or its relevant affiliates may require us to file and maintain an
effective shelf registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of SoftBank Group&#146;s Registrable Securities. The registration of the resale of these securities will facilitate the public sale by SoftBank Group of such
securities without regard to any limitations on the volume of securities that SoftBank Group may sell. In light of SoftBank Group&#146;s expected beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares after giving effect to this offering, the registration of

interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of $735 million of the ADSs offered in this offering at the initial public offering price and on the same terms and conditions as the other purchasers in this offering. Because these indications of interest
are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, any of the Cornerstone Investors may determine to purchase more, fewer, or no ADSs in this offering, or the underwriters may determine to sell more, fewer, or no ADSs to any of the Cornerstone
Investors. If any of the Cornerstone Investors are allocated a portion or all of, or more than, the ADSs in which they have indicated an interest in purchasing in this offering, their election to purchase any such ADSs could reduce the available

not exceed the initial public offering price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a

results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. We will not have any control over the analysts&#146; content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading
opinion regarding us, our business model, financial performance, ADS price or otherwise, our ADS price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose
visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause our ADS price or trading volume to decline and result in the loss of all or a part of your investment in us. </P>

Even so, ADS holders may not know about a meeting far enough in advance to withdraw those ordinary shares. If we ask for the instructions of holders of the ADSs, the depositary, upon timely notice from us, will notify ADS holders of the upcoming
vote and arrange to deliver our voting materials to them. Upon our request, the depositary will mail to ADS holders a shareholder meeting notice that contains, among other things, a statement as to the manner in which voting instructions may be
given to the depositary. We cannot guarantee that ADS holders will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying their ADSs. A shareholder is only entitled to participate
in, and vote at, the meeting of shareholders, provided that it holds our ordinary shares as of the record date set for such meeting and otherwise complies with the Articles. In addition, the depositary&#146;s liability to ADS holders for failing to
execute voting instructions or for the manner of executing voting instructions is limited by the deposit agreement. As a result, holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise their right to give voting instructions or be able to vote in person or by

Amendments may reflect, among other things, operational changes in the ADS program, legal developments affecting ADSs or changes in the terms of our business relationship with the depositary. In the event that the terms of an amendment are
materially disadvantageous to ADS holders, ADS holders will only receive 30&nbsp;days&#146; advance notice of the amendment, and no prior consent of the ADS holders is required under the deposit agreement. Furthermore, we may decide to direct the
depositary to terminate the ADS facility at any time for any reason. For example, terminations may occur if we decide to list our ordinary shares on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> securities exchange and determine not to continue
to sponsor an ADS facility or when we become the subject of a takeover or a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">going-private</FONT> transaction. If the ADS facility will terminate, ADS holders will receive at least 30 days&#146; prior notice, but no

courts would be treated by English courts as a cause of action in itself and sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the issues would be necessary, provided that certain requirements are met. Whether these requirements are met in

improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management&#146;s attention may be diverted from other

activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application
in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance
practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management&#146;s time and attention from
revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory
authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also expect that being a public company combined
with these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors also
could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified senior management and members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and remuneration committee. </P>

will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do
not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. </P>

U.S. investors. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, we will be a PFIC for any taxable year in which, after the application of certain look-through rules
with respect to our subsidiaries, either (1) 75% or more of our gross income consists of passive income or (2) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of our assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive
income (including cash and cash equivalents). For purposes of these tests, passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, gains from certain sales or exchanges of investment property and certain rents and royalties. If
we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. investor holds our shares, we will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. investor for all succeeding taxable years during which such U.S. investor holds our
ordinary shares or ADSs, even if we cease to meet the threshold requirements for PFIC status. Such U.S. investor may be subject to adverse tax consequences with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs, including ineligibility for any preferential tax
rates on capital gains or on actual or deemed dividends, interest charges on certain taxes treated as deferred and additional reporting requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that we will furnish to such U.S. investor information that may be
necessary to comply with the reporting and tax paying obligations applicable under the PFIC rules of the Code. Such U.S. investor should consult its tax advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investment in our ordinary
shares or ADSs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based upon the value of our assets and the nature and composition of our income and assets, we expect that we will not be
classified as a PFIC for the taxable year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, although no assurances can be made in this regard. However, the determination of whether we are a PFIC is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual basis applying principles
and methodologies that in some circumstances are unclear and subject to varying interpretation. For instance, for our current and future taxable years, the total value of our assets (including goodwill) for PFIC testing purposes may be determined in
part by reference to the market price of our ordinary shares or ADSs from time to time, which may fluctuate considerably. If our market capitalization declines while we hold a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents for any taxable year, we
may be a PFIC for that taxable year. Furthermore, under the income test, our status as a PFIC depends on the composition of our income for the relevant taxable year, which will depend on the transactions we enter into in the future and our corporate
structure. The composition of our income and assets is also affected by how we spend the cash we raise in any offering. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not be treated as a PFIC for the current or any future taxable year and our
U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to our PFIC status for any prior, current or future taxable year. Even if we determine that we are not a PFIC for a taxable year, there can be no&nbsp;assurance that the IRS will agree with our
conclusion and that the IRS would not successfully challenge our&nbsp;position. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For further discussion of the PFIC rules and the adverse

Shifting (the &#147;Inclusive Framework&#148;) have put forth two proposals&#151;Pillar One and Pillar Two&#151;that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively. In July 2023, the U.K.
enacted legislation to implement the OECD framework for Pillar 2, part of which will apply effectively from January 1, 2024. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the Inclusive
Framework&#146;s proposals. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. These changes, if enacted into law,
could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows. We are continuing to monitor legislative developments and are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the U.K. and other legislation on our
financial position, future results of operations and cash flows. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, but the
ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined. We are unable to predict what tax reform may be
proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase
the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our financial statements, and otherwise affect our financial position, future results of operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall or effective tax
rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">post-tax</FONT> returns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. Additionally, our future tax liability
could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in applicable tax jurisdictions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we may periodically
restructure our legal entities and if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our tax liability could be materially affected. In connection with any restructuring we could also incur
additional charges associated with consulting fees and other charges. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We carry out extensive research and development activities, and as
a result, we benefit in the U.K. from the research and development expenditure credit (&#147;RDEC&#148;) regime, which provides relief against U.K. corporation tax. Broadly, RDEC provides a tax credit currently equal to 20% of &#145;qualifying
research and development expenditure&#146; incurred from April&nbsp;1, 2023 (the rate was previously 13% of qualifying research and development expenditure incurred from April&nbsp;1, 2020 to March&nbsp;31, 2023) by certain companies where certain
criteria are met. To the extent a company cannot utilize the RDEC against U.K. corporation tax then certain rules apply that allow the RDEC to, among other things, reduce the tax liability of certain specified taxes (for example, value added tax or
employee taxes), or be surrendered to a group company, and to the extent it is not possible to utilize the RDEC in full, then the net tax credit is paid to the company by HMRC in cash. Between January 2023 and March 2023, the U.K. government ran a
consultation on the design of a single, simplified R&amp;D tax relief scheme, expected to be based on the RDEC scheme, which would merge the existing RDEC and small and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">medium-sized</FONT> enterprise R&amp;D relief.
The U.K. government is considering the responses and no decision has yet been made. We expect that, if implemented, the new scheme will be in place for expenditures incurred after April&nbsp;1, 2024. </P>

products (and other qualifying income) to be taxed at an effective corporation tax rate of 10%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If, however, there are unexpected adverse
changes to the RDEC or the &#147;patent box&#148; regime (including any such changes which result from the U.K. government&#146;s response to its consultation on the design of a single, simplified R&amp;D tax relief scheme), or for any reason we are

applicable laws and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. See the section titled &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks<B> </B>Relating to this Offering and Ownership of Our Securities&#151;Because we do not anticipate paying any cash

previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. In addition, as a public limited company in England, we will only be able to make a distribution if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of our called-up
share capital and undistributable reserves and if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate. </P>

with nominal assets and liabilities, contingencies and commitments. After consummating the corporate reorganization described herein, including the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-registration</FONT> of Arm Holdings Limited as a public limited
company, Arm Holdings plc became the ultimate holding company for Arm Limited. Arm Limited in turn was incorporated as a private company with limited liability under the laws of England and Wales on November&nbsp;12, 1990. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm Holdings plc is a holding company which, since formation, has not conducted any operations other than activities incidental to the

shares allotted as a bonus issue, and to allow the creation of a new class of deferred shares (which carry no or extremely limited voting rights, and no right to share in the income or capital of Arm Holdings Limited). On August 21, 2023, Arm
Holdings Limited undertook a reorganization of its share capital to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-divide</FONT> its share capital of 100 ordinary shares of &pound;1.00 each into 100,000 ordinary shares of &pound;0.001 each. </P>

energy-efficient CPUs have enabled advanced computing in greater than 99% of the world&#146;s smartphones, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and more than 250&nbsp;billion chips, cumulatively, powering everything from the tiniest of sensors to
the most powerful supercomputers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We enable any company to make a modern computer chip through the unique combination of our <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">energy-efficient</FONT> CPU IP and related technologies and our unmatched ecosystem of technology partners. Our primary product offerings are leading CPU products that address diverse performance, power, and cost
requirements. Complementary products such as GPUs, System IP, and compute platforms are also available and enable high-performance, efficient, reliable, system-level creation for a wide range of increasingly sophisticated devices and applications.
Our development tools and robust software ecosystem have further solidified our position as the world&#146;s most widely adopted processor architecture. Our partners include leading semiconductor technology suppliers (including foundries and EDA
vendors), firmware and operating system vendors, game engine vendors, software tool providers and application software developers. Our solution, combined with the breadth of our software ecosystem and the millions of chip design engineers and
software developers that utilize it, has created a virtuous cycle of adoption, which means that software developers write software for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> devices because it offers the biggest market for their products,
and chip designers choose Arm processors because they have the broadest support of software applications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today, Arm CPUs run the vast
majority of the world&#146;s software, including the operating systems and applications for smartphones, tablets and personal computers, data centers and networking equipment, and vehicles, as well as the embedded operating systems in devices such
as smartwatches, thermostats, drones and industrial robotics. The exponential rise in smart devices in both consumer and enterprise markets has increased the demand for chips that provide more computational capability while optimizing for energy
efficiency. This trend has driven the dramatic growth of Arm CPUs over the past several years. The scale of our reach continues to expand, with more than 30&nbsp;billion <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> chips reported as shipped in
the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 alone, representing an approximately 70% increase since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our creation of the Arm CPU architecture, the world&#146;s most widely used CPU architecture, has resulted in the proliferation and evolution
of computers as people know them today. We enabled the mobile phone and smartphone revolution, and through our focus on energy efficiency and our history of continuous innovation, we have enabled new categories of &#147;smart&#148; consumer
electronics. Today, we are redefining what is possible in industries such as cloud computing, automotive, and IoT. As a result, in the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, more than 260 companies reported that they had shipped <FONT

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, most customers licensed our products under the terms of a TLA. In 2019 and
2021, we introduced the Arm Flexible Access and Arm Total Access agreements, respectively, to enable the widest range of customers to access our products through methods best suited to their particular business needs. We believe that the Arm Total
Access and Arm Flexible Access agreements provide enhanced flexibility for our customers (as compared to the TLA business model) and increase the number of chip designs using our products. While certain customers will elect to remain TLA customers,
some customers are in the process of transitioning from TLAs to Arm Total Access and Arm Flexible Access agreements. We may experience variability in license revenues due to the timing of product deliveries within each TLA, Arm Total Access and Arm
Flexible Access agreement. However, because Arm Total Access and Arm Flexible Access agreements are renewable in nature, as customers transition away from TLAs, we expect our visibility into future license revenues to improve. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We typically are able to command a royalty for chips that contain our products, which creates a long-term recurring revenue opportunity from
each design win. We typically see sustained revenue streams from older chips, as products containing those chips continue to be sold and older processors are incorporated into new chips, creating a cumulative effect that fuels long-term growth. For
example, based on royalty revenue information provided to us by customers in quarterly royalty reports, approximately 46% of our royalty revenue for the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 came from products released between 1990 to 2012.
Additionally, as we transition to more Arm Total Access and Arm Flexible Access licenses, we expect more of our products to be incorporated into more of our customers&#146; chip designs, and our royalty revenue to increase over time as a result.

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Semiconductor chips are essential components in consumer, enterprise, and automotive electronics, which has resulted in sustained
and increasing long-term demand for semiconductor chips, a significant percentage of which contain our products. Our license and royalty revenues are, in part, affected by market conditions in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical by nature
and impacted by broad economic factors, such as worldwide gross domestic product and consumer and enterprise spending. While the semiconductor industry has experienced significant, prolonged, and sometimes sudden downturns in the past, we expect
there to be continued and increasing demand for semiconductors over the long term as macro trends drive device manufacturers to produce more powerful and energy-efficient devices. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because our royalty revenue is dependent on the number of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-powered</FONT> chips shipped by our customers,
dislocations created by cyclical, economic factors generally affect demand for our customers&#146; chips and, consequently, may result in variability in our operating performance. Royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in the quarter in which
the customer ships products incorporating our products. A material portion of the accrual is estimated using trend analysis of market and sales data as well as customer-specific financial information with a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">true-up</FONT> in the following quarter based on actual sales data once received. Accordingly, differences between our estimated market trends and our customers&#146; forecasts of their chip shipments can lead to
variability in our royalty revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our Market Share Across End Markets </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm CPUs are the world&#146;s most widely licensed and deployed processors. Our products are used in almost all smartphones, the majority of
tablets and digital TVs, and a significant proportion of all chips with embedded processors, including for both consumer and enterprise applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a greater than 99% share of the smartphones market and
a very high share in a range of other electronic devices, from digital TVs to drones. As new high-growth markets for electronics emerge and incorporate more AI and ML workloads, they require our more advanced processor designs in areas such as cloud
computing, the automotive industry, and the IoT economy. Our operating and financial performance is dependent, in large part, upon maintaining our market share in the smartphone and consumer electronics markets and maintaining or growing market
share in our other target markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Ability to Provide Our Customers with More Value Per Chip </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe our ability to continue to develop more advanced products and offer increasingly comprehensive product packages, including providing
more complete subsystems, will encourage greater use of our products by existing and prospective customers. For example, some licensees may combine multiple different Arm CPUs in a single chip, Arm CPUs with other Arm IP such as Arm GPUs, or deploy
Arm CPU implementations with more than 100 cores. Some customers may be better served by the integration of our IP into a subsystem with additional information to assist in fabrication. For chips where our products have provided more value, we will
typically receive a higher royalty rate per chip. Accordingly, we believe that our investments in higher performance, higher efficiency, and more specialized designs will drive greater demand for our products and higher value for our customers,
which is expected to result in higher royalty fees. Our future performance is dependent on our continued ability to provide value to customers, and our ability to drive additional value through technological innovation. </P>

pipelines, which we believe positions us to capture design wins to a greater extent than our competitors. A &#147;design win&#148; occurs when a customer decides to include an Arm CPU product or
related technology within one of their chip designs. For customers who already license our products, a new design win does not necessarily require a customer to sign a new license. By licensing a portfolio of Arm products to our customers (rather
than licensing a single CPU design or other technology design), we have made it easier and more compelling for customers to access and utilize more Arm products, further broadening our potential customer base and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-market</FONT> penetration. Our licensing options provide greater flexibility to our customers and maximize our opportunities to secure more design wins for our products, which results in greater opportunities to

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We depend on our commercial relationship with Arm China to access the PRC market, and a significant portion of our total revenue is generated
from Arm China, a related party. Arm China has the right to sublicense our processor technology pursuant to the IPLA. Our responsibility under the IPLA is to facilitate delivery of our processor technology to Arm China&#146;s end customers in
accordance with detailed instructions and other specifications from Arm China. For additional information regarding the IPLA, see &#147;Business&#151;The IPLA with Arm China.&#148; Our revenue is calculated as a percentage of license and royalty
fees earned by Arm China from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-license</FONT> arrangements entered into with its end customers. Where our revenue is earned as a percentage of the license fee received by Arm China, we categorize such revenue as
our license revenue. Our share of Arm China&#146;s royalties is categorized as Royalties in our financial statements. Despite our significant reliance on Arm China through our commercial relationship with them, both as a source of revenue and as a
conduit to the important PRC market, Arm China operates independently of us. Under the IPLA, Arm China&#146;s payments due to us are determined based on the financial information that Arm China provides to us. Accordingly, we are dependent on Arm
China providing us with reliable and timely financial information. Additionally, political actions, including trade and national security policies of the U.S. and PRC governments, such as tariffs, placing companies on restricted lists, or new
end-use controls, have in the past, currently do and could in the future limit or prevent us, directly or through our commercial relationship with Arm China, from transacting business with certain PRC customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or
discourage certain PRC customers or suppliers from transacting business with us or Arm China, or make it more expensive to do so, which could adversely affect demand for our products. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, although our total
revenues derived from the PRC increased as compared to the prior year, the growth in our royalty revenues slowed for the same period primarily as a result of economic issues in the PRC and factors related to export control and national security
matters. Furthermore, in light of these issues, we expect to continue to see declining royalty revenues derived from the PRC and we could see a decline in licensing revenues. See &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and
Industry&#151;Our concentration of revenue from the PRC market makes us particularly susceptible to economic and political risks affecting the PRC, which could be exacerbated by tensions between (on the one hand) the U.S. or the U.K. and (on the
other hand) the PRC with respect to trade and national security.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Developments in Export Control Regulations </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2022, the BIS of the U.S. Department of Commerce published changes to U.S. export control regulations that restrict the PRC&#146;s
semiconductor and supercomputing industries&#146; ability to obtain advanced computing chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop and maintain supercomputers and manufacture advanced semiconductors. We have been
impacted by the implementation in October 2022 of rules by the BIS, which principally relate to (i)&nbsp;implementing new process requirements that require licensees to disclose semiconductor manufacturing facilities used for manufacturing <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> integrated circuit designs; and (ii)&nbsp;controlling previously <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-controlled</FONT> Arm interconnect IP as well as releasing a modified version of such IP that does not
exceed the BIS performance thresholds for the PRC. We anticipate additional changes to U.S. export control regulations in the future, but we cannot forecast the scope or timing of such changes. We will continue to monitor such developments,
including potential additional trade restrictions, and other regulatory or policy changes by the U.S. and foreign governments. </P>

reports received in the 12-month period from April 1 to March 31 of each year relate to chip shipments made in the period from January 1 to December 31 of each year. We also perform various procedures to assess customer data related to royalties for

Arm China. We believe that, over time, many of our customers will transition to either an Arm Total Access or Arm Flexible Access license to access our products. This transition enables us and our customers to focus less on contract negotiations and
more on how our products can be deployed in our customers&#146; future chips. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We consider the number of extant Arm Total Access and Arm

royalty revenue in the future, improving our long-term market share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Annualized Contract Value </I></B></P>

contracted through Arm China per the aggregate license fee as shared under the IPLA. We define ACV as the total annualized committed fees, excluding any potential future royalty revenue, for all signed agreements deemed to be active through the last
day of each applicable reporting period. Arm Total Access agreements and ALAs are deemed to be active for, and annualized over, the number of years in the contract. Any other license agreements, including single use and limited use licenses issued
under an Arm Flexible Access agreement or TLA, are deemed to be active for, and annualized over, three years based on the historical licensing patterns of our customers. The aggregate license fee shared by Arm China is also deemed to be active for,
and annualized over, three years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ACV is an operational metric based on committed fees, excluding royalties, not recognized revenue, and
therefore is not reconcilable to, nor a substitute for, revenue reported under GAAP. However, we consider ACV to be a key operational metric that we use to track existing licensing commitments with our customers. Bookings of new licenses and
recognized revenue may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter due to customer buying patterns, timing of subscription renewals and as a function of contract duration. As a result, we believe ACV provides an additional understanding of our
business performance and long-term trends. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Non-GAAP Financial Measures </I></B></P>

minus capital expenditures and intangibles, offset by proceeds realized from capital disposal activities. We believe that Non-GAAP free cash flow is a meaningful indicator of liquidity that provides information to our management and investors about
the amount of cash generated from operations, after purchases of property and equipment and purchases of intangible assets, that can be used for investment in our business and for acquisitions as well as to strengthen our balance sheet. Non-GAAP
free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operations. Non-GAAP free cash flow does not reflect our
ability to meet future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. For more information regarding our use of this measure and a reconciliation to the
most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see &#147;&#151;Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Reconciliation

compensation expense of $26 million due to liability-settled share-based compensation expense credits primarily attributable to executive departures. Total share-based compensation expense, including both cash and equity settled awards, was
$158&nbsp;million and $13 million for the fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the share-based compensation income of $7 million pertains to a decrease in fair value of certain <FONT

initial public offering. Liability-classified awards are remeasured at the end of each reporting period through the date of settlement to ensure that the expense recognized for each award is equivalent to the amount to be paid in cash or equity

have two components: license fees and support and maintenance fees (recognized as license and other revenue) and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-chip</FONT> royalties (recognized as royalty revenue). However, some licenses can have multiple
payment milestones that are date-based or event-based (e.g., six months after the effective date of the contract or upon <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tape-out</FONT> of the first chip design). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We disaggregate revenue into the following major categories: </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">License and other revenue includes revenue from licensing, software development tools, design services, training, support, and all other fees
that do not constitute royalty revenue. The products licensed by us consists of design information and related documentation to enable a customer to design and manufacture semiconductor chips and related technology. Over the term of a license,
contractual payments can generally range from hundreds of thousands of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the type of license, its duration, and the type of product that is being licensed. A license may be perpetual, <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">use-limited</FONT> or time-limited in its application. Delivery (i.e., providing the customer access to the licensed products) generally occurs within a short period after executing a license agreement. In some cases, we
may license products that are still under development, in which case delivery can be many months, or even years, after executing a license agreement. We generate a significant proportion of our Licensing and other revenues from a relatively small
number of customers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">License fees are invoiced pursuant to an agreed schedule. Typically, the first invoice is generated upon signing of
the license agreement, and licensing and other revenue is recognized upon delivery of the products. In addition to the license fees, our license agreements generally provide for customer support services, which consist of telephonic or <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-mail</FONT> support. Fees for customer support services are generally specified in the contract. Typically, no upgrades to the licensed products are provided, except those updates and upgrades provided on a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">when-and-if-available</FONT></FONT></FONT> basis. Revenues from customer service support are recorded within other revenues. </P>

payable by our customers under our Arm Total Access agreements upon <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tape-out</FONT> because manufacturing design rights are included within the portfolio license fee and are reflected in the license pricing. We
believe that Arm Total Access agreements are most suitable for larger, established, semiconductor companies who expect to deploy our products in a wide range of their products. As of June 30, 2023, we had 20 extant Arm Total Access agreements with

royalty rates per chip typically reduce over time as the total volume of chips incorporating our products shipped increases; notwithstanding such reductions in royalty rates and fees per chip, license agreements with component manufacturing
customers typically include a minimum royalty percentage or fee per chip. Royalty payment schedules in individual license agreements vary depending on the nature of the license and the degree of market acceptance of our products on the date the
license agreement is executed. In addition, the amount of royalty payments in respect of our products can increase as the customer integrates more of our products into the chip. See &#147;&#151;Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Operating
Results&#151;Ability to Provide Our Customers with More Value Per Chip&#148; above for examples of how customers may incorporate multiple products in a single chip. License contracts require the licensee to issue royalty reports, including details
of chip sales, to us on a quarterly basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Royalty revenue is recognized on an accrual basis in the quarter in which the customers ship
chips containing our products, using an estimate based on sales trends and judgment for several key attributes, including industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our products, and average selling price (with a <FONT

which requires increased development efforts that may be partially offset by improvements in productivity. Consequently, each year we increase our R&amp;D investment in line with the increased development needs of the next generation of products.
Engineers are in high demand and well-remunerated, and accordingly our increased R&amp;D activity will continue to result in an increase in costs, principally driven by salaries for such technical employees and the costs of tools they need. </P>

for employee termination benefits depends on whether employees are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period in order to receive the termination benefits. If employees are required to render service beyond a minimum retention
period in order to receive the termination benefits, costs are recognized ratably over the applicable future service period. Otherwise, costs are recognized when the Company has committed to a restructuring plan and has communicated those actions to
employees. Employee termination benefits covered by existing benefit arrangements are recognized when the Company has committed to a restructuring plan and the termination benefits are probable and estimable. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Total revenue was $675&nbsp;million and $692&nbsp;million for the fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and
2022, respectively. License and other revenue was $275&nbsp;million and $258&nbsp;million for the fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in license and other revenues was primarily driven by new licensing deals
as well as renewals of our existing license arrangement by customers to gain access to the latest versions of our technology IPs. Royalty revenue was approximately $400&nbsp;million and approximately $434&nbsp;million for the fiscal quarters ended
June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in royalty revenue was driven primarily by the macroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to normalize inventory levels. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Revenue from external customers increased by $11&nbsp;million during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the fiscal quarter
ended June&nbsp;30, 2022, driven primarily by a $33&nbsp;million increase in license and other revenue, which was partially offset by a $22&nbsp;million decrease in royalty revenue. Revenue from related parties decreased by $28&nbsp;million during
the fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 as compared to the fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2022, primarily driven by a $16&nbsp;million decrease in license and other revenue and a $12&nbsp;million decrease in royalty revenue as a result of
trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and PRC governments, which adversely affected PRC semiconductor suppliers and customers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022 revenue from sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately
57% and approximately 62% of total revenue, respectively. Less than 2% of our total revenue is denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenues and results of operations for the
fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022 was immaterial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Cost of sales </I></P>

and other revenue was $1,004&nbsp;million and $1,141&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in license and other revenue primarily was due to marginal decrease in size and timing of new
licensing deals. License revenue may potentially be volatile across periods due to variability of large deals between fiscal years, which historically have had a large license revenue impact. Royalty revenue was approximately $1,675&nbsp;million and
approximately $1,562&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in royalty revenue was driven primarily by continued organic growth as a result of higher net ASP per chip and increased adoption
of our products by customers in their chips. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Revenue from external customers decreased by $194&nbsp;million during the fiscal years ended
March&nbsp;31, 2023 as compared to the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022, driven primarily by a $333&nbsp;million decrease in license and other revenue, which was partially offset by a $139&nbsp;million increase in royalty revenue. Revenue from
related parties increased by $170&nbsp;million during the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 as compared to the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022, primarily driven by a $196&nbsp;million increase in license and other revenue, which was
partially offset by a $26&nbsp;million decrease in royalty revenue as a result of economic and national security issues currently ongoing in the PRC. </P>

59% and approximately 54% of total revenue, respectively. Less than 2% of our total revenue is denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenues and results of operations for the
fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was immaterial. </P>

and other revenue was $1,141&nbsp;million and $714&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in license and other revenue primarily was due to an increase in licensing revenue from three
high-value license agreements and as we introduced new approaches to licensing certain of our products to provide more customers with more reasons and more ways to license. Royalty revenue was approximately $1,562&nbsp;million and approximately
$1,313&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in royalty revenue was driven primarily by continued organic growth as a result of higher net ASP per chip and increased adoption of our products

increase was due to general increases in salaries and related expenses and share-based compensation, increases in cloud engineering expenses, including cloud services, depreciation, and allocated facility overheads, partially offset by decreases in
employee related retention awards and increases in research and development tax credits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>2022 compared to 2021 </I></P>

Other Revenue increased quarter over quarter driven by continued adoption of our technology product offerings, with the exception of the second quarter and fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The declines in those quarters were
predominantly due to marginal decrease in size and timing of new licensing deals. Our deals include term license recognized at the point in time upon delivery to the customer. License revenue may potentially be volatile across periods due to
variability of large deals between quarters, which historically have had a large license revenue impact. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Royalty Revenue </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Royalty revenue increased quarter over quarter driven by continued organic growth as a result of higher net ASP per chip and increased adoption
of our technology products by customers in their chips, with the exception of the third quarter and fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The declines in those two quarters were primarily as a result of economic and national
security issues currently ongoing in the PRC. The impact of these policies was more pronounced in the second half in comparison to the first half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. We expect this volatility to continue in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2024 and beyond. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Cost of sales and Gross profit </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our quarterly cost of sales trends do not vary directly with our license and other revenue and royalty revenue. As a result, we have not
experienced large fluctuations in the amount of our cost of sales from period to period. Our quarterly cost of sales expenses consist of employee-related expenses, project costs associated with professional services and the provision of support and
maintenance to customers, along with expenses related to license development services revenue, amortization of developed technology, and allocated overhead. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fluctuations in our gross profit for each of the periods presented were directly impacted by our total revenue for the same period. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our operating expenses primarily consist of research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel related expenses
are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and associated benefits. Operating expenses also include cloud infrastructure costs and allocated overheads, amongst other items.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Total operating expenses generally increased in each of the periods presented except for the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and June 30,
2022, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses, share based compensation, cloud infrastructure and other related costs to support our growth. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We experienced a decrease in total operating expenses during the first quarter ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter ended
March 31, 2022 primarily as a result of increase in bonus awards, acceleration of employee retention awards and one-time restructuring charges incurred in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2022. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also experienced an increase in total operating expenses in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the earlier quarters of
same fiscal year primarily as a result of new grants of share-based compensation, increase in bonus awards and increase in litigation provisions, incurred in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2023. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the first quarter ended June 30, 2023, we experienced a decrease in total operating expenses compared to the fourth quarter ended March 31,
2023 primarily as a result of decreases in employee retention awards, share-based compensation, and litigation provisions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We intend to
continue to make significant investments in research and development as we expand our existing technology product offerings. We also intend to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our cash obligations as they become due, including requirements of our business operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, acquisitions and investments,
and other commitments. We have historically financed, and intend to continue to finance, our operations primarily through cash generated from our business operations, partially supported by government research grants and tax credits. For the fiscal
quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022, the government research grant and tax credits benefits recognized were approximately $34&nbsp;million and $24&nbsp;million, respectively. For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the
government research grant and tax credits benefits recognized were approximately $83&nbsp;million, $84&nbsp;million and $94&nbsp;million, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,248&nbsp;million
and short-term investments of $801&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be
adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the 12 months following the date of this prospectus and in the longer term. Our future capital requirements will depend on several factors, including our revenue growth, the timing and extent
of spending on R&amp;D efforts and other growth initiatives, the timing of new products and services introductions, market acceptance of our products, and overall economic conditions. We could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding
through debt or equity financing; however, additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued
innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. See &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry.&#148; </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical and
anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Although
we believe that the estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results could differ materially (either positively or negatively, as applicable) from our estimates, which could have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of management judgment and complexity. Accordingly, the following policies we believe are the most critical to aid in
fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Revenue Recognition </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our revenue is derived from contracts with customers. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (&#147;ASC 606&#148;). The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue upon the transfer of services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange
for those services or products. We apply the five-step framework under ASC 606 to recognize revenue as described in our revenue recognition policy included in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct
performance obligations, the evaluation of the standalone selling price (&#147;SSP&#148;) for each performance obligation and the assessment of the contract combination criteria. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Determination of distinct performance obligations </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For our licensing arrangements, we grant customers the choice to acquire additional rights, goods, or services at contract inception (for
example, renewals of offerings, version extensions through term renewals, additional future products, or additional usage of term license). Therefore, judgment is required in determining whether products and services are considered distinct
performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. We utilize forward-looking information in identifying performance obligations for IP or their version extensions of architecture IP under development or future products and in
considering if implicit promises exist in certain long-term contracts. </P>

not available for our products, so we estimate the SSP for each performance obligation by maximizing the use of observable inputs. Some of our performance obligations, such as support, maintenance services, and training services, have observable
inputs that are used to determine the SSP of those distinct performance obligations. However, our licenses of products often have highly variable pricing as standalone sales are rare and pricing varies from one transaction to another. When offerings
with highly variable pricing lack substantial direct costs to estimate SSP based on a cost-plus margin approach, the transaction price is allocated using the residual approach on the basis that we have identified the SSP for other performance
obligations in the same contract. If two or more performance obligations have highly variable or uncertain pricing, we apply a combination of methods to estimate the SSPs, including utilizing list prices, contract prices, and effort estimates of
future IP. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Assessment of contract combination criteria </I></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For certain license arrangements, sales-based royalties are collected on customers&#146; chips that incorporate our products. Royalties are set
either as a percentage of the licensee&#146;s average selling price per chip or as a fixed amount per chip. Royalties are recognized on the licensee&#146;s sales in the period in which they ship their
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-powered</FONT> chips to their end customers. Our estimates of royalty-based accruals take into consideration the macroeconomic effects of global events, such as COVID-19, geopolitical issues (such as trade bans
or wars), and natural disasters, any of which may interrupt supply chain activities as well as demand for shipments of technology products. These estimates also involve the use of historical data and judgment for several key attributes, including
industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our products, and average selling price. Generally, our estimates represent the then-current period&#146;s shipments for which we expect our licensees to submit royalty
statements in the following quarter in accordance with our license agreements. Upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensees with the actual reporting of sales-based royalties that we previously estimated, we record a favorable or
unfavorable adjustment based on the difference, if any, between estimated and actual sales. Historically, actual amounts for sales-based royalties have been materially consistent with our estimates, and no significant adjustments have been required
for prior-period royalty estimates. However, we can provide no assurances that material adjustments will not be required in future periods. </P>

over its remaining life. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate reflective of the risks associated with an investment in a similar company in a similar industry or having a similar history of revenue growth. For each
valuation, we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the value of invested capital for both the income approach and market-calibration approach. The financial forecast considered our past results and expected future financial
performance. The risk associated with achieving this forecast was assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates as the assumptions used are highly subjective and subject to changes as a result

Monte Carlo simulation model simulates our equity value at an assumed listing exit event in order to determine the RSU vesting percentage. The model simulates the RSU vesting percentage over one million iterations, and the average of all iterations
is the fair value of an RSU. The model then discounts the future value of RSU at the assumed listing exit event date back to the valuation date based on the risk-free rate. The Monte Carlo simulation model incorporates various assumptions such as

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We used the income approach and market-calibration approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses to
measure the fair value of the All Employee Awards. The income approach estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future cash flows the business is expected to generate over its remaining life. The estimated present value is
calculated using a discount rate reflective of the risks associated with an investment in a similar company in a similar industry or having a similar history of revenue growth. For each valuation, we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the
computation of the value of invested capital for both the income approach and market-calibration approach. The financial forecast considered the Company&#146;s past results and expected future financial performance. The risk associated with
achieving this forecast was assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates as the assumptions used are highly subjective and subject to changes as a result of new operating data and economic and
other conditions that impact the business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market-calibration approach analyzes the percent change in the enterprise values of peer
companies between the prior valuation date and the current valuation date. Based on the observed market movement in the enterprise values of peer companies, a market movement factor is selected to represent the potential shift in enterprise value
between the prior valuation date and the current valuation date. The selected market movement factor is applied to the indicated value as of the prior valuation date. </P>

assumed. We have identified one reporting unit. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to
assess the likelihood of an impairment of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. If our assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value of our reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired

likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value. Our goodwill impairment test considers the income method and/or market method to estimate a reporting unit&#146;s fair value. Significant judgments are required in assessing impairment of goodwill include the
identification of reporting units, estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount and growth rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value, whether an
impairment exists and if so the amount of that impairment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of the

began as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple Computer, and VLSI Technology. We were publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market from 1998 until 2016, when we were taken private by SoftBank Group, our
controlling shareholder. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The original joint venture set out to develop a processor that was high performance, power efficient, easy to
program, and readily scalable &#150; a goal that continues to define Arm today. One of the first <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> products was a predecessor of today&#146;s tablets. As a battery-powered device, it required an
energy-efficient chip to maximize its battery life while providing the necessary compute capabilities. This product benefited from Arm&#146;s clear focus on efficient CPU design. Our CPUs initially gained significant traction in mobile phones in the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-1990s</FONT> because our energy-efficient processors provided an appropriate level of performance while consuming little power, which was critical for these smaller form factor devices. As the mobile phone market
continued to grow rapidly, more semiconductor companies entered the market. All these companies needed to source high-performance, energy-efficient processors to run their mobile phone software, and many of them licensed Arm CPU products. Over time,
mobile phones, and the chips they used, became more advanced and ultimately evolved into the smartphones that are prevalent today. The Arm CPU proved to be critical in enabling the smartphone revolution. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Semiconductors are indispensable to everyday life. In today&#146;s technology-driven world, semiconductors are the enablers of the devices and
infrastructure that facilitate virtually everything people do, such as making a phone call, sending an email, storing files in the cloud, streaming videos, or traveling by car, train, or plane. Almost all of the products and services people use
every day rely on semiconductors. Manufacturing, logistics, city infrastructure, and building management also increasingly build their processes and services around semiconductor-enabled devices. As consumers and enterprises continue to demand more
from their devices, the pervasiveness of high-performance and energy-efficient semiconductors will continue to expand. We believe there are several key trends driving the growth and evolution of the semiconductor industry. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Proliferation of Smart, Connected Devices Supporting an Increasingly Digital World </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The world is becoming increasingly digital with the proliferation of smart, connected devices, such as smartphones, wearables, PCs, tablets,
and other electronic devices. Even everyday products like washing machines, thermostats, and utility meters are becoming more advanced. According to Deloitte&#146;s 2022 Connectivity and Mobile Trends Survey, the average U.S. household had 22
connected devices in 2022, doubling from 11 devices in 2019. The market trend to make nearly all products smart and connected is not just limited to consumer electronics, but is also driving a wave of innovation across a broad range of end markets
and use cases. For example, vehicles are effectively transforming into computers on wheels, factory floors are becoming increasingly automated with robotics, and retail shopping is evolving with the help of cashier-less checkout technology. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Increased Need for High-Performance, Power-Efficient Compute </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The massive expansion of data, advanced software applications, and AI are driving the need for
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">high-performance</FONT> compute capabilities. To address increasingly complex workloads, a key approach has been to increase the speed of a CPU and expand the number of processor cores per chip. For example, core
count increased by approximately tenfold between 2010 and 2022 for many smartphone application processors and by more than 30 times over the same period for certain data center server chips. Moreover, the number of cores per &#147;high end&#148;
Arm-based chip has increased from 8 in 2016 to 192 in 2023. Solely running an existing chip faster may deliver more compute performance, but increasing performance in this way results in higher energy costs, and may cause thermal limits to be
exceeded. For example, individual servers are limited by their ability to dissipate heat energy, while whole data centers are limited by how much electricity is available to them. Mobile devices are limited by the energy stored in their batteries,
while their instantaneous power is limited by thermal constraints. Furthermore, the transition to electric vehicles is increasing pressure on automakers to consider the power consumption and thermal management of vehicle electronics. In addition,
enterprises are increasingly mindful of environmental sustainability, which is driving a need for more efficient alternatives to offset the continued growth in data centers and other compute deployments. According to McKinsey, the energy usage from
data centers is expected to increase two times by the end of 2030 relative to 2022 levels. Collectively, these considerations result in the need for innovation in chip design to address market demands for an optimal balance of performance,
efficiency, size, and cost across end markets. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resources required to develop leading-edge products are significant and continue to increase exponentially as manufacturing process nodes
shrink. According to IBS, IC design costs were approximately $249 million for a 7nm chip and approximately $725 million for a 2nm chip, representing approximately a three-times increase in design cost as compared to a 7nm chip. Design partners play
an increasingly valuable role in the chip design process by providing specialized capabilities and expertise that enable semiconductor suppliers to focus on their core product differentiation, while keeping pace with market innovation. Design
partners facilitate innovation and enhance customers&#146; competitive positioning by reducing the complexity, risk, and cost of a significant part of the development cycle. For example, to design a 2nm chip, IBS estimates that the software
development, verification, and IP qualification is 71% of the overall cost. In addition, design partners, like Arm, that can demonstrate a deep understanding of their customers&#146; workloads are better positioned to integrate themselves into their
customers&#146; workflows, further expanding their value proposition over time. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt" ALIGN="center">

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many OEMs today utilize <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;off-the-shelf,&#148;</FONT></FONT> or
&#147;merchant,&#148; semiconductors when building their product offerings. However, this approach can introduce compromises. For example, an OEM may use a chip that includes features that are irrelevant for its use case, at the expense of
performance and cost efficiency. Similarly, an OEM may need a chip that incorporates features not otherwise available from a merchant supplier. As a result, leading OEMs are increasingly looking to build custom chips in-house that deliver greater
performance and greater efficiency at an equal or better price for a particular use case. The successes of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> products such as Amazon AWS&#146; Graviton, deployed across Amazon AWS data centers
globally, have demonstrated the opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage through this approach. For example, Amazon AWS claims that Graviton delivers up to 40% better price performance over comparable x86-based systems. This trend
of increasing use of in-house developed solutions has significantly expanded the opportunity for Arm. </P>

an industry leader for many years and continues to be the most widely deployed architecture globally. Since our inception, our customers have shipped more than 250&nbsp;billion <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> chips, and we estimate
that Arm had an approximate 48.9% market share by value in the calendar year ended December&nbsp;31, 2022, up from approximately 38.7% in the calendar year ended December 31, 2014. Our products are used in virtually all smartphones, a majority of
tablets and digital TVs, and a significant proportion of all chips with embedded processors. We have an established presence in the cloud market, working with many of the largest hyperscalers, including Amazon AWS, Alibaba, Alphabet and Microsoft.
In 2018, we entered the cloud compute market, and, as of December&nbsp;31, 2022, we have grown our market share to approximately 10.1%. In the automotive market, we work with many of the leading suppliers, and we believe that, on average, each new
vehicle produced in our fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 contained approximately <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">13&nbsp;Arm-based</FONT> chips. Our products deliver leading performance per watt and provides the flexibility to design custom
chips, addressing the growing need for power-efficient compute capabilities. We believe that these factors, which have driven our success in the mobile and consumer electronics markets, are emerging as key factors in the automotive, cloud compute,
networking equipment, and other growth markets. </P></TD></TR></TABLE>

the world&#146;s largest ecosystem of third-party software and hardware partners, including chip design and verification tools vendors, advanced fabrication, operating system and application vendors, software tools providers, and training and
support services companies. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, more than 1,000 partner companies were invested in developing products that complement Arm&#146;s technology, allowing Arm customers to get their products to market more efficiently with reduced
cost, development time, and risk. The wide deployment of chips based on the Arm ISA provides software and tools companies with a large market to develop and sell their products into. As of March 31, 2023, there were more than 8&nbsp;million apps
running on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> devices built by more than 15&nbsp;million developers designing software for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> systems. We estimate that Arm&#146;s engineers invested more
than 10&nbsp;million hours in creating the base software and tools for chips containing Armv8 processors, and that the developers have then spent another 1.5 billion hours creating their apps and software. We also estimate that Arm will be investing
more than 30&nbsp;million hours creating the base software and tools for Armv9 processors, which will enable the next generation of apps and software for Arm-based chips. The breadth of our ecosystem creates a virtuous cycle that benefits our
customers and deeply integrates us into the design cycle because it is difficult to create a commercial product or service for a particular end market until all elements of the hardware and supporting software and tools ecosystem are available.
Building the required software ecosystem around an architecture requires significant investment and can take decades. For instance, we started to invest in the technology and ecosystem for the server market in 2007, but it took over 10 years for Arm
to start to gain share, given the lack of an existing hardware/software ecosystem at the start. </P></TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that we have the industry&#146;s largest ecosystem of third-party software and hardware partners, including advanced manufacturing,
OS and application developers, software tools vendors, and training and support services. The availability of our marketing, sales and support services to our ecosystem is critical to the success of our products and allows us to create and maintain
deep customer and partner relationships, through which we have visibility into the future requirements of the end markets for our products. As of March 2023, we had over 650 employees across the world dedicated to marketing, sales, and partner
enablement. We market our products directly to our semiconductor partners and customers from our offices across the world. Our CPUs and related technologies are marketed on the basis of a number of factors, including performance, power consumption,
price, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">speed-to-market,</FONT></FONT> support and maintenance offerings and the availability of third-party support. We also capitalize on the extensive marketing and distribution
networks of our semiconductor partners who market and distribute our products directly to systems companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our solution is used by many
different types of customers, including major chip vendors, OEMs, service providers, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">start-ups</FONT> or small business units, and researchers and academics. The combination of billions of chips, shipping into myriad
end markets, the breadth of our software ecosystem, and the millions of chip design engineers and software developers collectively has created a virtuous cycle in which software developers write software for
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</FONT> devices because it is the biggest market for their products, and chip designers choose our processors because they have the broadest support network. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to
continue to attract and retain customers through our dedicated marketing, sales and partner enablement teams. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Research and Development </B></P>

meet evolving market demands. Our engineers are involved in researching and developing new versions of processor cores, specialist processors, such as graphics IP and AI accelerators, System IP and Physical IP technology as well as related software
and tools applications. Our significant research and development investments and increasing market share in certain markets, such as mobile applications processors, consumer electronics, and embedded computing, enable us to invest more effectively

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our success and ability to compete effectively depend significantly on protecting our IP. To protect our IP rights, we primarily rely on
patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements, as well as license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others. We have an active program of protecting our proprietary
technology through the filing of patents, registration of trademarks, and use of confidentiality agreements and other IP rights. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, we owned or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-owned</FONT> approximately 6,800 issued
patents and have approximately 2,700 patent applications pending worldwide. The majority of these patents and patent applications fall into the categories of processor architecture and microarchitecture, ML and computer vision, graphic processor
architecture, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-chip</FONT> system design and memory technology. We maintain and support an active program to protect our IP, primarily through encouraging engineers to propose new invention submissions and
defending issued patents against infringement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Approximately 97% of our active patent portfolio (granted and pending) is owned solely by
us, or jointly with, our subsidiaries, with the remaining 3% comprising patent assets jointly owned with one or more third parties. Through <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">intra-group</FONT> licensing arrangements, we have access to our entire
patent portfolio for the purposes of licensing technology or otherwise providing services to third parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of our global
operations, efforts to protect our technology, trade secrets and other proprietary information can be difficult, particularly in jurisdictions that provide limited or no protection for IP rights. If confidential information (including, but not
limited to, trade secrets, and proprietary technology and information) is improperly shared we would likely seek to determine the source and whether or not financial losses could be recovered through contractual claims against a licensee.
Additionally, we would seek to block importation of finished goods created in such &#147;limited-protection&#148; territories into territories where there exist better protections. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no
assurance that such measures will be successful. See &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry&#151;Failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our IP rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary
products and our brand, and the costs of obtaining, maintaining, protecting, defending and enforcing such IP rights, particularly as a result of litigation, may adversely and materially affect our results of operations.&#148; </P>

September&nbsp;13, 2023, the total number of ordinary shares subject to outstanding RSU awards granted under the Prior Plans is 39,218,388, and the aggregate value of outstanding Executive Awards
granted under the Prior Plans is $95&nbsp;million, which is comprised of potential fixed monetary amounts of $70&nbsp;million of One-time Launch Awards (as described below) with customized vesting schedules for certain of our executive officers and
$25&nbsp;million of Annual Awards (as described below) that vest based on the achievement of certain performance metrics for the fiscal year ending March&nbsp;31, 2024. We do not plan to grant further awards under the Prior Plans following the
completion of this offering. Instead, equity-based awards granted at or after the completion of this offering will be under our new omnibus incentive plan. The principal features of the four previously-adopted plans that pertain to outstanding
awards held by our executive officers and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-executive</FONT> directors, and the principal features of our 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#147;Omnibus Incentive Plan&#148;), are summarized below. With respect to

also granted Executive Awards with customized vesting schedules to certain of our executive officers. Annual Awards and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">One-time</FONT> Launch Awards could be settled differently depending on whether vesting occurs
before or after our initial public offering. The Annual Award typically consists of a portion that is subject only to a time-based vesting schedule and a portion that is subject to a performance-based and time-based vesting schedule. The time-based
portion of the Annual Award vests on an annual basis over three years. The performance-based portion vests on an annual basis over three years, with each year&#146;s vesting amount being within a range of 0% to 200% of the award value based on
whether our annual performance metrics are satisfied. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">One-time</FONT> Launch Awards vest on an annual basis over three years, with no performance-based vesting conditions. We have also granted Executive Awards
with terms that differ from those described above. Generally, these awards provide for all or a portion of the award to vest upon the earliest to occur of our initial public offering, a change in control event and a specified future date, subject to
continued employment through the applicable vesting date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before our initial public offering, any portion of the Executive Awards that

right of our remuneration committee to satisfy all or part of any such vested portion in cash. As with the RSU awards, upon a change of control event, which generally includes the acquisition of more than 50% of the voting power of our shares or the
sale of all or substantially all of our assets, a pro rata portion of the unvested Executive Awards will vest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Generally, unvested awards

employment or service as an executive director), except that if the cessation to be an eligible employee or executive director in question is due to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ill-health,</FONT> injury, disability or death, our remuneration
committee may vest all or a portion of that participant&#146;s awards. The executive officer will not be treated as ceasing to be an eligible employee or executive director for these purposes upon leaving the employment of a member of our group if,
within the following seven days, he or she recommences employment with another member of our group. The awards will also lapse if our remuneration committee determines that part or all of any such unvested awards should lapse in accordance with any

incorporated as a private limited company with the legal name Arm Holdings Limited under the laws of England and Wales on April&nbsp;9, 2018, with the company number 11299879. Arm Holdings Limited
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-registered</FONT> as a public limited company on September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2023 and changed its name to Arm Holdings plc. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm Limited was incorporated as a private limited company with the legal name Widelogic Limited under the laws of England and Wales on
November&nbsp;12, 1990 with the company number 02557590. On December&nbsp;3, 1990, Widelogic Limited changed its company name to Advanced RISC Machines Limited, and, on May&nbsp;21, 1998, it changed its company name to Arm Limited, which was a
wholly owned subsidiary of Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782. Our business was initially operated through Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782, which was previously an independent publicly traded corporation until its
acquisition in September 2016 by SoftBank Group. On March&nbsp;19, 2018, as a part of a reorganization, Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-registered</FONT> as a private limited company and was
renamed SVF HoldCo (UK) Limited, which became a subsidiary of SoftBank Vision Fund, which retained an approximate 25% interest in our company with the remainder beneficially held by SoftBank Group. In August 2023, a subsidiary of SoftBank Group
acquired substantially all of SoftBank Vision Fund&#146;s interest in Arm Limited at a purchase price of approximately $16.1 billion, with the associated payments to be made in installments over a two-year period. The purchase price was established
by reference to the terms of a prior contractual arrangement between the parties. Accordingly, prior to this offering, SoftBank Group beneficially owns substantially all of our outstanding shares. Our registered office is 110 Fulbourn Road,
Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB1 9NJ, U.K. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the terms of our corporate reorganization: (i)&nbsp;each ordinary share in the
capital of Arm Holdings Limited was transferred, by way of a dividend in specie, by Arm Limited to each of the shareholders of Arm Limited in an approximate proportion to the shareholding that such shareholders held in Arm Limited; (ii)&nbsp;the
shareholders of Arm Limited exchanged each of the ordinary shares held by them in Arm Limited for newly issued ordinary shares of Arm Holdings Limited of the same class and in approximately the same proportions as their previous shareholding in Arm
Limited, and as a result, Arm Holdings Limited became the sole shareholder of Arm Limited; and (iii)&nbsp;Arm Holdings <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Limited&nbsp;re-registered&nbsp;as</FONT> a public limited company and changed its name to Arm

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">English law generally provides shareholders with statutory preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for a
company&#146;s articles of association, or shareholders at a general meeting representing at least 75% of our ordinary shares present (in person or by proxy) and voting at that general meeting, to disapply these preemptive rights. Such a
disapplication of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the Articles, if the disapplication is contained in the Articles, or from the date of the shareholder resolution, if the disapplication
is by shareholder resolution. In either case, this disapplication would need to be renewed by the Company&#146;s shareholders upon its expiration (i.e., at least every five years). On August 25, 2023, our shareholders approved the disapplication of
preemptive rights for a period ending August 25, 2028, which disapplication will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) to remain effective, but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or for any
shorter period). </P>

agreed to act as the depositary for the ADSs. Citibank&#146;s depositary offices are located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013. ADSs represent ownership interests in securities that are on deposit with the depositary. ADSs may be
represented by certificates that are commonly known as American Depositary Receipts. The depositary typically appoints a custodian to safe keep the securities on deposit. In this case, the custodian is Citibank, N.A., London Branch, located at
Citigroup Centre, Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5LB, United Kingdom. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have appointed Citibank as depositary pursuant to a
deposit agreement. A copy of the deposit agreement will be on file with the SEC under cover of a registration statement on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">F-6.</FONT> You may obtain an electronic copy of the deposit agreement from the
SEC&#146;s website (www.sec.gov). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are providing you with a summary description of the material terms of the ADSs and of your material
rights as an owner of ADSs. Please remember that summaries by their nature lack the precision of the information summarized and that the rights and obligations of an owner of ADSs will be determined by reference to the terms of the deposit agreement
and not by this summary. We urge you to review the deposit agreement in its entirety. The portions of this summary description that are italicized describe matters that may be relevant to the ownership of ADSs but that may not be contained in the
deposit agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each ADS represents the right to receive, and to exercise the beneficial ownership interests in, one ordinary share
that is on deposit with the depositary and/or custodian. An ADS also represents the right to receive, and to exercise the beneficial interests in, any other property received by the depositary or the custodian on behalf of the owner of the ADS but
that has not been distributed to the owners of ADSs because of legal restrictions or practical considerations. We and the depositary may agree to change the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ADS-to-ordinary</FONT></FONT> share ratio by amending the deposit agreement. This amendment may give rise to, or change, the depositary fees payable by ADS owners. The custodian, the
depositary and their respective nominees will hold all deposited property for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of ADSs. The deposited property does not constitute the proprietary assets of the depositary, the custodian or their
nominees. Beneficial ownership in the deposited property will, under the terms of the deposit agreement, be vested in the beneficial owners of the ADSs. The depositary, the custodian and their respective nominees will be the record holders of the
deposited property represented by the ADSs for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the corresponding ADSs. A beneficial owner of ADSs may or may not be the holder of ADSs. Beneficial owners of ADSs will be able to receive, and to
exercise beneficial ownership interests in, the deposited property only through the registered holders of the ADSs, the registered holders of the ADSs (on behalf of the applicable ADS owners) only through the depositary, and the depositary (on
behalf of the owners of the corresponding ADSs) directly, or indirectly, through the custodian or their respective nominees, in each case upon the terms of the deposit agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you become an owner of ADSs, you will become a party to the deposit agreement and therefore will be bound to its terms and to the terms of
any ADR that represents your ADSs. The deposit agreement and the ADR specify our rights and obligations as well as your rights and obligations as an owner of ADSs and those of the depositary. As an ADS holder, you appoint the depositary to act on
your behalf in certain circumstances. The deposit agreement and the ADRs are governed by New York law. However, our obligations to the holders of ordinary shares will continue to be governed by the laws of England and Wales, which may be different
from the laws of the U.S. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, applicable laws and regulations may require you to satisfy reporting requirements and obtain

represented by your ADSs through the depositary only to the extent contemplated in the deposit agreement. To exercise any shareholder rights not contemplated in the deposit agreement you will, as an ADS owner, need to arrange for the cancellation of
your ADSs and become a direct shareholder. The manner in which you own the ADSs (e.g., in a brokerage account vs. as registered holder, or as holder of certificated vs. uncertificated ADSs) may affect your rights and obligations, and the manner in
which, and the extent to which, the depositary&#146;s services are made available to you. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As an owner of ADSs, you may hold your ADSs
either by means of an ADR registered in your name, through a brokerage or safekeeping account, or through an account established by the depositary in your name reflecting the registration of uncertificated ADSs directly on the books of the
depositary (commonly referred to as the direct registration system or DRS). The direct registration system reflects the uncertificated (book-entry) registration of ownership of ADSs by the depositary. Under the direct registration system, ownership
of ADSs is evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the holders of the ADSs. The direct registration system includes automated transfers between the depositary and DTC, the central book-entry clearing and settlement system for
equity securities in the U.S. If you decide to hold your ADSs through your brokerage or safekeeping account, you must rely on the procedures of your broker or bank to assert your rights as an ADS owner. Banks and brokers typically hold securities
such as the ADSs through clearing and settlement systems such as DTC. The procedures of such clearing and settlement systems may limit your ability to exercise your rights as an owner of ADSs. Please consult with your broker or bank if you have any
questions concerning these limitations and procedures. All ADSs held through DTC will be registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. This summary description assumes you have opted to own the ADSs directly by means of an ADS registered in your name
and, as such, we will refer to you as the &#147;holder.&#148; When we refer to &#147;you,&#148; we assume the reader owns ADSs and will own ADSs at the relevant time. </P>

law, vest in the depositary or the custodian the record ownership in the applicable ordinary shares with the beneficial ownership rights and interests in such ordinary shares being at all times vested with the beneficial owners of the ADSs
representing the ordinary shares. The depositary or the custodian shall at all times be entitled to exercise the beneficial ownership rights in all deposited property, in each case only on behalf of the holders and beneficial owners of the ADSs
representing the deposited property. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Dividends and Other Distributions </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a holder of ADSs, you generally have the right to receive the distributions we make on the securities deposited with the custodian. Your
receipt of these distributions may be limited, however, by practical considerations and legal limitations. Holders of ADSs will receive such distributions under the terms of the deposit agreement in proportion to the number of ADSs held as of the
specified record date, after deduction of the applicable fees, taxes and expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Distributions of Cash </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whenever we make a cash distribution for the securities on deposit with the custodian, we will deposit the funds with the custodian. Upon
receipt of confirmation of the deposit of the requisite funds, the depositary will arrange for the funds received in a currency other than U.S. dollars to be converted into U.S. dollars and for the distribution of the U.S. dollars to the holders,
subject to the laws and regulations of England and Wales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The conversion into U.S. dollars will take place only if practicable and if the

our ADSs remain listed on Nasdaq and are regularly traded, we expect to be a qualified foreign corporation for purposes of dividends paid by us constituting qualified dividend income. However, the qualified dividend income treatment will not apply
if we are treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder for our taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year. The amount of the dividend will be treated as foreign-source dividend income to U.S. Holders and will not be eligible
for the dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S. corporations under the Code. Dividends will generally be included in a U.S. Holder&#146;s income on the date of the U.S. Holder&#146;s actual or constructive receipt of the dividend.
The amount of any dividend income paid in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of actual or constructive receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted

of our income for the relevant taxable year, which will depend on the transactions we enter into in the future and our corporate structure. The composition of our income and assets is also affected by how we spend the cash we raise in any offering.
Even if we determine that we are not a PFIC for a taxable year, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our conclusion and that the IRS would not successfully challenge our position. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurances that

any gain from such deemed sale would be subject to the rules described below. After the deemed sale election, so long as we do not become a PFIC in a subsequent taxable year, the U.S. Holder&#146;s ordinary shares or ADSs with respect to which such

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on HMRC&#146;s published practice, no U.K. stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition or transfer of ADSs and/or ADRs. Furthermore, an
agreement to transfer ADSs and/or ADRs will not give rise to a liability to SDRT. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Withdrawals and Subsequent Transfers of ordinary
shares </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A transfer of ordinary shares (as opposed to ADSs and/or ADRs) will generally be subject to U.K. stamp duty (if the ordinary
shares are held in certificated form) or SDRT (if the ordinary shares are held in uncertificated form), in either case at the rate of 0.5% (or potentially 1.5% in certain circumstances) of the amount or value of the consideration paid for the
ordinary shares (for example in respect of transfer of ordinary shares or a redeposit of ordinary shares into the ADR program). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further,
SDRT will generally be payable on an unconditional agreement to transfer ordinary shares in certificated form at 0.5% (or potentially 1.5% in certain circumstances) of the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer, but is repayable if,
within six years of the date of the agreement, an instrument transferring the ordinary shares is executed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Therefore, you are strongly
encouraged to hold your ADSs (representing ordinary shares) in book-entry form through the facilities of the Depositary Trust Company. </P>

stabilizing transactions, which involves making bids for, purchasing and selling ADSs in the open market for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the ADSs while this offering is in progress. These stabilizing
transactions may include making short sales of ADSs, which involves the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of ADSs than they are required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing ADSs on the open market to cover positions created by
short sales. Short sales may be &#147;covered&#148; shorts, which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional ADSs referred to above, or may be &#147;naked&#148; shorts, which are short
positions in excess of that amount. The underwriters may close out any covered short position either by exercising their option to purchase additional ADSs, in whole or in part, or by purchasing ADSs in the open market. In making this determination,
the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of ADSs available for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriters may purchase ADSs through the option to purchase additional ADSs. A naked short position
is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the ADSs in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters
create a naked short position, they will purchase ADSs in the open market to cover the position. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The underwriters have advised us that,
pursuant to Regulation&nbsp;M of the Securities Act, they may also engage in other activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the ADSs, including the imposition of penalty bids. This means that if the representatives of the
underwriters purchase ADSs in the open market in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales, the representatives can require the underwriters that sold those ADSs as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the ADSs or preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the ADSs and, as a result, the price of the ADSs may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If the underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them at any time. The underwriters may
carry out these transactions on Nasdaq, in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">over-the-counter</FONT></FONT> market or otherwise. </P>

America, Inc., are lenders under the Existing SoftBank Group Facility and/or have entered into the New SoftBank Group Facility as lenders and/or agents thereunder, in respect of which they have received and/or expect to receive various fees and
interest on the loans. A subsidiary of SoftBank Group has granted a security interest with respect to substantially all of our share capital to secure the Existing SoftBank Group Facility and will initially grant a security interest with respect to
769,029,000 of our ordinary shares, representing a 75.01% equity interest in us (before giving effect to the issuance of ordinary shares issuable upon the completion of this offering in connection with the vesting of RSUs and Executive Awards), to
secure the New SoftBank Group Facility. SoftBank Group has advised us that the Existing SoftBank Group Facility is expected to be repaid prior to, or concurrently with, the pricing of this offering, and the New SoftBank Group Facility is expected to
be funded following, or concurrently with, the closing of this offering. The repayment of the Existing SoftBank Group Facility and the release of our obligations thereunder is a condition to the closing of this offering. In case of an event of
default under the New SoftBank Group Facility, the lenders would be in a position to enforce their security interest with respect to our ordinary shares, which may therefore result in a disposal or sale of our ADSs by the lenders and could cause the
trading price of our ADSs to decline. In addition, the lenders might carry out hedging transactions in order to cover financial risk relating to the pledged securities. </P>

and Morrison&nbsp;&amp; Foerster LLP that there is currently no treaty between (i)&nbsp;the U.S. and (ii)&nbsp;England and Wales providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters
(although the U.S. and the U.K. are both parties to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards) and that a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any general or state court in the U.S. based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in England and Wales. We have also been advised by Morrison&nbsp;&amp; Foerster (UK) LLP and Morrison&nbsp;&amp; Foerster LLP that
any final and conclusive monetary judgment for a definite sum obtained against us in the U.S. courts would be treated by the courts of England and Wales as a cause of action in itself and sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the
issues would be necessary, provided that certain preconditions are met, including, but not limited to, that the relevant U.S. court had jurisdiction over the original proceeding according to English conflicts of laws principles and that the U.S.
judgment was final and not procured by fraud. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whether the preconditions are met in respect of a judgment based upon the civil liability
provisions of the United States securities laws, including whether the award of monetary damages under such laws would constitute a penalty, is an issue for the court making such decision. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally
available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the English court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is
or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">set-off</FONT> or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Also note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the
judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings. It should also be noted that in the
courts of England and Wales the usual rule is that the losing party is ordered to pay the legal costs of the litigation that were incurred by the successful party. These costs are assessed by the courts of England and Wales at the conclusion of the
litigation. </P>

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10b-5</FONT> under the Exchange Act. Since many of the disclosure obligations required of us as a foreign private issuer are different than those required of U.S. domestic reporting companies, our shareholders,
potential shareholders and the investing public in general should not expect to receive information about us in the same amount, or at the same time, as information is received from, or provided by, U.S. domestic reporting companies. We are only
liable for violations of the rules and regulations of the SEC that apply to us as a foreign private issuer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will send the depositary a

statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
(&#147;GAAP&#148;) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). The Company&#146;s fiscal year ends on March 31<SUP STYLE="font-size:75%; vertical-align:top">st</SUP>. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. </P>

currency of the respective entity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For transactions entered into in a currency other than its functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities are

are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-monetary</FONT> balance sheet amounts, which
are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-operating</FONT> income (loss), net on the Consolidated Income Statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company translates functional currency assets and liabilities to their USD equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income

statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, share-based
compensation, impairment considerations for long-lived assets, fair value estimates and impairment for investments. The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and revises estimates as circumstances change. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience, anticipated results, trends, and other various assumptions that it believes are reasonable. Inputs used in judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or third-party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, short-term investments, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable. The Company&#146;s
maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of these assets. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by
international credit rating agencies. The Company further manages its credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of investment type and credit exposures. For accounts receivable, the credit risk is
managed through the use of mitigating controls, including the use of credit checks and credit limits on customers. For financial assets (other than accounts receivable), the Company holds positions with an approved list of investment-grade rated
counterparties and monitors the exposures and counterparty credit risk on a regular basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, in March 2022, the Company entered into a
Guarantee (as defined below) as discussed more fully in Note 19, <I>Commitments and Contingencies,</I> relating to the payment obligations under the Facility Agreement owed by Kronos (as defined below), an entity under common control of SoftBank
Group Corp. (&#147;SoftBank Group&#148;). Under the terms of the arrangements, a subsidiary of Kronos secured the obligations under the Facility Agreement (as defined below) by pledging its 75.01% interest in the Company and upon an Arm Guarantee
Trigger Event (as defined below) as discussed in Note 19, <I>Commitments and Contingencies</I>, the Company may become exposed to the credit risk of Kronos failing to pay its obligations, monetize the share collateral to settle the obligations
directly, or otherwise restructure the Facility Agreement before obligations are due. Upon default, the lenders can satisfy their claim either through foreclosing on the pledged 75.01% interest in the Company or through enforcing the Company&#146;s
obligations pursuant to the Guarantee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents </I></B></P>

convertible into known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value because the short-term maturity of those instruments. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, which requires separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
from goodwill, based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the fair value of any
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-controlling</FONT> interests in the acquiree over the net of the estimated acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible
assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and the useful lives of the assets. Although the Company&#146;s fair value estimates
are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result,
during the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final
determination of fair values of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings on the Consolidated Income Statements. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the
business combination and expensed as incurred. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Goodwill </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during
the fourth fiscal quarter or during interim periods whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value at the Company&#146;s
reporting unit level, which is the same or one level below the operating segment level. The Company determined it has one reporting unit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">more-likely-than-not</FONT> that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-step</FONT> quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further
testing is required. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers primary factors such as industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations. </P>

judgment when determining the amount of consideration, it expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. This includes estimates as to whether, and to what extent, subsequent concessions or payments
may be granted to customers, which release customers from their obligations to pay contractual fees. In this judgment, historical trends are considered with respect to both the specific customer and broader Company trends. The Company estimates the
transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. Consideration payable to a customer is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue
unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service that the customer transfers to the Company. The transaction price also excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes. The Company&#146;s
revenue arrangements may include variable consideration, including royalties. Where minimum royalties are agreed with customers and there is no uncertainty of their receipt, the amount is allocated to performance obligations as a part of the
transaction price. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company considers relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether a contract contains a significant financing component. The
Company has not identified significant financing components in its material revenue arrangements executed during the financial year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Allocation of
Transaction Price </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Judgment is required when estimating standalone selling prices (&#147;SSPs&#148;). There is also judgment involved in determining
whether the pricing of certain performance obligations is highly variable or uncertain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other than support and maintenance, SSPs are usually not directly
observable for the Company&#146;s products and services because the Company generally does not sell its products or services on a standalone basis. The Company estimates the SSPs so that the Company allocates the transaction price to each
performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. The Company allocates royalties entirely to the
licenses that give rise to them. When estimating a SSP, the Company considers available information and maximizes the use of observable inputs such as renewal pricing history for the Company&#146;s standardized support and professional service
offerings. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For offerings that have highly variable or uncertain pricing and lack substantial direct costs to estimate
based on a cost-plus margin approach, the transaction price is allocated by applying a residual approach. This is on the basis that the Company has identified SSP for other performance obligations in the same arrangement. If two or more goods or
services in a contract have highly variable or uncertain pricing, then the Company applies a combination of methods to allocate transaction price, including utilizing list prices, contract prices, and effort estimates of future IPs, for initial
allocation of residual amount of transaction price within such products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For customer agreements related to long-term licensing of architecture IP, the

Special Administrative Region, but excludes Taiwan (collectively referred to as the &#147;PRC&#148;), under the intellectual property licensing arrangement (&#147;IPLA&#148;). Arm China directly contracts with end customers with discretion in
establishing pricing to sublicense specified IP. The Company&#146;s responsibility under the IPLA is to facilitate delivery of a good or service to the end customer in accordance with detailed instructions and other specifications from Arm China. In
these cases, Arm China is the customer for the Company. As such, revenue presented by the Company is the net amount calculated as a percentage of license and royalty fees earned by Arm China from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-license</FONT>
arrangements entered into with end customers. The Company applies the royalty exception, under which revenue is recognized when the subsequent sale or usage occurs, assuming control of the license to which the royalty relates has transferred to the
customer. Where the revenue is derived as a percentage of the license fee of Arm China, the Company categorizes that portion as license revenue while the other portion, which represents the Company&#146;s share of Arm China&#146;s royalties, is
categorized as royalties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Contract Balances and Receivables </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes accounts receivable in full when it has the contractual right to invoice the customer and begins satisfying the performance obligation
over the term of the contract. Judgment is required to determine whether a right to consideration is unconditional and thus qualifies as a receivable. Contract assets are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied and the Company does
not have the contractual right to invoice. Accrued royalties are presented as accrued income in accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Contract liabilities primarily reflect invoices due, or payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Typically, the Company invoices either all or a
substantial portion of the fees for IP licenses upfront on the effective date of the contract. Periodic fixed fees for software support services, and other multi-period agreements are typically invoiced in advance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Customer deposits primarily relate to payments received from customers which could be refundable pursuant to the terms of the contract and are in other

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment
within 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of the
Company&#146;s invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a license term with revenue recognized over the contract period, and not to
receive financing from customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of the Company&#146;s contracts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Allowance
for Current Expected Credit Losses </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Trade receivables are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects the
Company&#146;s best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit
losses, accounts receivable is segmented into pools of assets depending on market (China versus international) and delinquency status, and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of accounts receivables. To determine the reserve
percentages for each pool of accounts receivables, the Company considers its historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future
forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored on a quarterly basis to determine whether there are any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted and
are considered on a regional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Please refer to Note 3, <I>Revenue</I>, for the summary of the movement in the allowance for current expected credit losses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against collections on a quarterly basis to determine whether the reserve
percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded. Accounts receivables are written off after all reasonable
means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) are exhausted. For the years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were immaterial to the consolidated financial
statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes an allowance for losses on contract assets based on a similar approach used for receivables under the current expected
credit loss model. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, the loss allowance for contract assets was immaterial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Share-based Compensation </I></B></P>

RSUs are granted by tranches either with a fixed number of awards or with fixed monetary amounts known at inception. Depending on the type of award, RSUs may require the achievement of certain performance conditions, market-conditions and for
certain awards, vesting occurs on the earliest of the following: (1)&nbsp;the occurrence of one of various events comprising a change in control of the Company, (2)&nbsp;an initial public offering of the Company&#146;s ordinary shares, and
(3)&nbsp;the passage of time. The number of RSUs that vest is determined by the achievement of market, performance and service conditions. The market condition target is tied to the valuation of the Company upon vesting. At the discretion of the

The fair value of RSUs is determined on the date of grant for equity-classified awards, and at the end of each reporting period for liability-classified awards, using Monte Carlo simulations or

liability-classified or equity-classified awards, respectively. Phantom Shares and certain RSUs are liability-classified and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period through the date of settlement so that the expense recognized for each
award is equivalent to the amount to be paid in cash. Changes in the fair value of liability-classified RSUs are recorded in the income statement over the vesting period of the award. Equity-classified RSUs are recognized using the straight-line
method over the service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A change in control or an initial public offering is generally not considered probable
until it has occurred. Accordingly, as of the balance sheet date, those RSUs that are subject to vesting on the earliest of (1)&nbsp;change of control, (2)&nbsp;initial public offering, or (3)&nbsp;passage of time, are expected to vest and be
settled in cash upon the passage of time. For liability-classified awards, the weighted average fair value of the RSUs was measured at each reporting date using the Monte Carlo simulation model or a discounted cash flow approach. Similarly, the fair
value for equity-classified awards was measured at the grant date using the discounted cash flow approach. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2021,
the Company used the discounted cash flow approach based on the expected value of the Company as a result of a business combination which was considered likely. For fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, the Company used the Monte Carlo
simulation model, the income approach and/or market-calibration approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses to measure the RSUs. The Monte Carlo simulation model simulates the Company&#146;s equity value at
an assumed listing exit event in order to determine the RSU vesting percentage. The model simulates the RSU vesting percentage over numerous iterations, and the average of all iterations is determined to be the fair value of an RSU. The model then
discounts the future value of the RSU at the assumed listing exit event date back to the valuation date based on the relevant risk-free interest rate. The Monte Carlo simulation model incorporates various assumptions such as expected stock price
volatility until a liquidity event, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and expected time to complete an initial public offering. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Company granted Phantom Shares and executive RSUs to certain of our executive officers and are subject to continuous service and vest upon meeting certain strategic performance conditions of the Company. Phantom Shares and executive RSUs are
liability-classified and are expensed when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. Executive RSUs primarily are based on fixed monetary amounts that could be converted into a variable number of shares based on the closing
share price of the Company upon an initial public offering. Any obligations that are based predominantly on fixed monetary amounts that are known at inception and are to be settled with a variable number of the Company&#146;s shares, are
liability-classified with compensation cost recognized ratably over the requisite service period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the grant date of the RSUs, the Company was private

<P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">was estimated using the income and market-calibration approaches. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The income approach estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future cash flows the business is expected to generate over its
remaining life. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate reflective of the risks associated with an investment in a similar company in a similar industry or having a similar history of revenue growth. For each valuation, the
Company prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the value of invested capital for both the income approach and market-calibration approach. The financial forecast considered the Company&#146;s past results and expected future
financial performance. The risk associated with achieving this forecast was assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates as the assumptions used are highly subjective and subject to changes as
a result of new operating data and economic and other conditions that impact the business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market-calibration approach analyzes the percent change in
the enterprise values of peer companies between the prior valuation date and the current valuation date. Based on the observed market movement in the enterprise values of peer companies, a market movement factor is selected to represent the
potential shift in enterprise value between the prior valuation date and the current valuation date. The selected market movement factor is applied to the indicated value as of the prior valuation date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Monte Carlo simulations incorporate highly subjective assumptions, such as stock price volatility and expected volatility until a liquidity event. Changes in
highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact share-based compensation cost. Since the Company&#146;s ordinary shares were not publicly traded, the computation of expected volatility was based on the average of historical and implied
volatilities over the expected term of the awards of a representative peer group of publicly traded entities. Other assumptions included expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate was based on <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">zero-coupon</FONT> U.S. Treasury bond rates corresponding to the expected term of the awards. Dividend assumptions were based on historical experience. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restructuring and other operating expenses consist primarily of employee termination benefits. Recognition of costs for employee termination benefits depends
on whether employees are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period in order to receive the termination benefits. If employees are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period in order to receive the termination
benefits, costs are recognized ratably over the applicable future service period. Otherwise, costs are recognized when the Company has committed to a restructuring plan and has communicated those actions to employees. Employee termination benefits
covered by existing benefit arrangements are recognized when the Company has committed to a restructuring plan and the termination benefits are probable and estimable. </P>

grants to compensate for its research activities. GAAP does not contain authoritative guidance for incentives and grants provided by governmental entities to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">for-profit</FONT> entity. Absent authoritative guidance,
interpretative guidance issued and commonly applied by financial statement preparers allows for the selection of accounting policies amongst acceptable alternatives. Based on facts and circumstances, the Company determined it most appropriate to
account for the government grants received by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20, <I>Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance</I> (&#147;IAS 20&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the provisions of IAS 20, a government grant is recognized when there is reasonable assurance the Company will meet the terms for receiving and
realizing the benefit of the grant. IAS 20 does not define &#147;reasonable assurance,&#148; however, based on certain interpretations, it is analogous to &#147;probable&#148; as defined under GAAP, which is the definition the Company has applied to

recognizes costs for which the grant is intended to compensate (i.e. qualified expenses). Further, IAS 20 permits for the recognition in earnings either separately under a general heading such as
other income, or as a reduction of the related expenses. The Company has elected to recognize the benefit as a reduction of the related expenses included in either research and development expenses or income tax expense on the Consolidated Income
Statements. For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the government grant benefit recognized was $83.0&nbsp;million, $84.3&nbsp;million and $94.4&nbsp;million, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The government grant benefit received includes a grant from Innovate U.K. for work connected to the creation of a new centrally secured technology platform
prototype. For the years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a reduction to research and development expenses from this grant of $2.6&nbsp;million, $15.3&nbsp;million and $23.8&nbsp;million, respectively. The maximum total

(&#147;HMRC&#148;) research and development expenditure (&#147;RDEC&#148;), which provides relief against U.K. corporation tax. Based on criteria established by HMRC a portion of the Company&#146;s expenditures incurred on research and development
activities are eligible for RDEC relief. For the years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company recorded a relief of $64.0&nbsp;million, $54.4&nbsp;million and $54.6&nbsp;million, respectively. </P>

for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be
realized or settled. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Company determines it is more likely than not that it will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the value of
some or all deferred tax assets (net of deferred tax liabilities), the Company will establish a valuation allowance offsetting the amount it does not expect to realize. The Company performs this analysis each reporting period and reduces the
measurement of deferred taxes if the likelihood the Company will realize them becomes uncertain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Deferred tax assets the Company records each period
depend primarily on the ability to generate future taxable income. Each period, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets and, if necessary, adjusts the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax
assets are recorded only to the extent the Company concludes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. If the outlook for future taxable income changes significantly, the Company&#146;s assessment of the need for,
and the amount of, a valuation allowance may also change. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is also required to evaluate and quantify other sources of taxable income, such as
the possible reversal of future deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Evaluating and quantifying these amounts is difficult and involves significant judgment, based on all of the available evidence and
assumptions about future activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it
is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely
to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized within income tax (expense) benefit on the Consolidated Income Statements. </P>

effect on an entity&#146;s operations and financial results. The results of disposals that qualify as a discontinued operation are presented as such for all reporting periods presented. Results of discontinued operations include all revenues and
expenses directly derived from such disposal group; general corporate overhead is not allocated to a discontinued operation. For disposals other than by sale such as a distribution to shareholders of the Company, results of operations of a business
would not be recorded as a discontinued operation until the period in which the business is actually disposed of other than by sale. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following a
strategic decision to place greater focus on the Company&#146;s core technology licensing business, a decision was made to distribute or sell certain components of the Company&#146;s Internet of Things business. As a result, in June 2021, the
Company completed a pro rata distribution of its controlling stake in Treasure Data, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#147;Treasure Data&#148;) to the immediate shareholders of the Company. In November 2021, the Company sold 100% of its ownership in
Pelion IOT Limited and its subsidiaries (&#147;IoTP&#148;) to SoftBank Group Capital Limited in exchange for $12.0&nbsp;million in cash consideration. The distribution of Treasure Data and sale of IoTP were accounted for as discontinued operations.

restructuring its investment in March 2022, the Company held an equity method investment in Arm China. Factors resulting in significant influence included: (a)&nbsp;the Company held a 48.18% equity holding in Arm China with associated rights;
(b)&nbsp;the Company was party to the IPLA and has service share transactions with Arm China, along with certain leases; and (c)&nbsp;the Company had the ability to nominate a representative to Arm China&#146;s board of directors. The Company
elected to apply the fair value option to this equity method investment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the IPLA, a substantial portion of customer contracts previously
held by the Company&#146;s former PRC subsidiary were novated to Arm China; under such contracts the Company is entitled to a share of revenue earned by Arm China. Where contracts were not novated from the Company&#146;s former PRC subsidiary to Arm
China, the Company has an obligation to pay a reseller fee on the revenue derived from those entities within the PRC geography. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2022, the
Company transferred its interest in Arm China to Acetone Limited, a newly created company.&nbsp;Immediately thereafter, the Company transferred 67% of its interest in Acetone Limited, to SoftBank Group Capital Limited (&#147;SBGC&#148;), and 23% of
its interest in SVF Holdco Limited (&#147;SVF&#148;) for a note receivable of $930.3&nbsp;million (the &#147;Note Receivable&#148;).&nbsp;The Note Receivable was immediately distributed proportionally to SBGC and SVF (the Company&#146;s only
shareholders), both entities under common control of SoftBank Group, free of cost and accordingly, treated similar to a dividend or distribution to the immediate shareholders of the Company as a reduction to retained earnings. </P>

Company did conclude that it has significant influence in Acetone Limited, as (a)&nbsp;Acetone Limited&#146;s sole asset is its 48.18% equity holding in Arm China, (b)&nbsp;the Company is party to the IPLA with Arm China, (c)&nbsp;the Company has
significant inter-entity transactions with Arm China, including leased assets; and (d)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer has been appointed to Arm China&#146;s board of directors by SoftBank Group. The Company elected to apply the fair

$975.7&nbsp;million. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of the Company&#146;s equity method investment in Acetone Limited was $92.4&nbsp;million and $108.4&nbsp;million, respectively </P>

receivable </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company issued a four-year loan of $25.0&nbsp;million to Arduino SA (&#147;Arduino&#148;) in July 2017. In March 2020, the Company
amended the terms of the loan receivable by reducing the annual interest rate from 6% to 3% and in conjunction with the amendment, the Company received Series A preferred stock of Arduino to partially settle the loan receivable. In April 2022, the
Company received Series B preferred stock in Arduino of $5.1&nbsp;million to partially settle the loan receivable. The Company accounts for this investment using the measurement alternative because such security is not publicly traded and does not
have a readily determinable fair value. For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2021, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $11.0&nbsp;million related to such investment. For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, the Company
did not record any impairment related to such investment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2021, the Company further amended the terms of the loan receivable by extending the
maturity date from July 2021 to April 2027. These amendments were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring. Under the troubled debt restructuring, unamortized fees and costs are carried forward and continue to be included in the amortized cost
basis of the loan receivable. Other direct third-party costs incurred were expensed as incurred and were included in other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-operating</FONT> income (loss), net on the Consolidated Income Statements. The Company
did not receive any fees in connection with these troubled debt restructurings. There were no payment defaults as the accrued interest and the principal amount of the loan receivable was only required to be repaid at maturity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2021, the loan receivable of $23.0&nbsp;million from Arduino was impaired in full as the balance was not expected to
be recovered, resulting in the recognition of an expected credit loss of $23.0&nbsp;million. The expected credit loss was recorded in other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-operating</FONT> income (loss), net on the Consolidated Income
Statements. For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company reduced the allowance for expected credit losses given the change in collectability with a corresponding reversal expense for the portion of the loan receivable that was repaid
in exchange for Series B preferred stock in Arduino. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the aforementioned Arduino loan receivable, the remaining balance for the fiscal year
ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022 comprised a four-year loan of $3.0&nbsp;million issued to Cerfe Labs, Inc., included in other loans receivable. The loan is at an interest rate comparable to market interest rates, with repayment due upon maturity.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company elected the fair value option in accordance with the guidance in ASC 825, <I>Financial Instruments</I> (&#147;ASC 825&#148;) for its investments in
Arm China, Acetone Limited, and Ampere. The Company initially computed the fair value for its investments consistent with the methodology and assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value with the assistance of a
third-party valuation specialist or based on inputs from the investee. The fair value computation is updated on a quarterly basis. The investments are classified within Level&nbsp;3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the fair
value of the investments using (i)&nbsp;the market-calibration approach based on the guideline public company method and/or (ii)&nbsp;subject to availability of sufficient information, the income approach based on the discounted cash flow method and
iii) the probability-weighted, expected return (&#147;PWER&#148;) approach. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market-calibration approach considers valuation multiples that are
calibrated to the valuation as of the prior valuation date (i.e., quarterly) based on: (a)&nbsp;changes in the broader market or industry; (b)&nbsp;changes in the guideline public companies; and (c)&nbsp;changes in the company&#146;s operating and
financial performance. The fair value computation under this approach includes a key assumption for the range of valuation multiples (i.e., enterprise value or revenue), which requires significant professional judgment by the valuation specialist
and is based on observable inputs (e.g., market data) and unobservable inputs (e.g., market participant assumptions). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to March&nbsp;31, 2022, the
income approach was used to measure the fair value of Ampere. For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the PWERM approach was used for the fair value measurement. The PWER approach is based on discrete future exit scenarios to determine the
value of various equity securities. Under the PWER approach, the share value today is based on the probability-weighted, present value of expected future distributions, taking into account the rights and preferences of each debt and equity class.
The Company considers an initial public offering scenario, a sale scenario, and a scenario assuming continued operation as a private entity for future exit scenarios. The fair value computation under this approach includes key assumptions for time
to liquidity outcomes, discounted rate, and present value factors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following table provides quantitative information related to certain key

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2021, the Company acquired a $29.0&nbsp;million convertible promissory note in Ampere, which is included in other
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-current</FONT> assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company&#146;s maximum exposure to loss are the amounts invested in, and advanced to, Ampere. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and
2022, the Company has not converted any of its convertible promissory note into equity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of the Ampere convertible loan is based upon
significant unobservable inputs, including the use of a probability weighted discounted cash flows model, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Therefore, the Company has categorized this asset as a Level&nbsp;3 financial asset. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the more significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the convertible loan include applicable discount rates, the likelihood
and projected timing of repayment or conversion, and projected cash flows in support of the estimated enterprise value of Ampere. Changes in these assumptions, while holding other inputs constant, could result in a significant change in the fair

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2019, an RSU plan was established for all employees of the Company. Vesting of these RSUs under the 2019 AEP requires the continuous service of the
employees through the vesting date, is subject to the achievement of a market condition target, and vesting occurs on the earliest of the following: (1)&nbsp;the occurrence of one of various events comprising a change in control of the Company,
(2)&nbsp;an initial public offering, or (3)&nbsp;the passage of time with the date being March&nbsp;9, 2026. The market condition target is tied to the valuation of the Company upon vesting. The plan allows for either share or cash settlement of the
RSUs at the discretion of the Company&#146;s remuneration committee. Upon the occurrence of a change in control or an initial public offering, and at the discretion of the Company&#146;s remuneration committee, each RSU converts into one ordinary
share on the vesting date. Conversely, upon the passage of time, each RSU is settled in cash at the vesting date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For all periods presented, a change in
control or an initial public offering is generally not considered probable until it has occurred. Accordingly, the RSUs will only be settled in cash upon the passage of time and are accounted as liability-classified awards. The Company also
maintains a subplan for employees of its subsidiary, Arm Technology Israel Ltd. (&#147;Arm Israel&#148;), in which RSUs will be settled in cash at the vesting date upon the occurrence of a change in control, initial public offering or the passage of
time with a long-stop date of March&nbsp;9, 2026. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Vesting requires continuous service until the passage of time and employees may elect not to
participate in the plan. RSUs are settled in cash at the vesting date and neither carry rights to dividends nor voting rights. Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the RSUs vest. For all periods presented, the aggregate
nominal amount of shares over which the Company&#146;s remuneration committee may grant awards under the 2019 AEP will be limited so that it does not exceed at any time an amount equal to 2.2&nbsp;percent of the aggregate nominal amount of the
Company&#146;s fully diluted equity share capital. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 11,601,185, 13,507,360 and 14,817,424 RSUs were outstanding, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, $56.0&nbsp;million, 30.8&nbsp;million and $37.5&nbsp;million of share-based compensation cost
respectively, and $11.6&nbsp;million, $5.4&nbsp;million and $3.2&nbsp;million of tax benefit, respectively, was recognized. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, $114.2&nbsp;million and $74.0&nbsp;million was recognized as a liability for the
liability-classified RSUs under the 2019 AEP in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-current</FONT> portion of accrued compensation and share-based compensation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, there

accounted for this acceleration as a modification of vesting in connection with a settlement which resulted in the recognition of incremental share-based compensation cost. For the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company recognized incremental
share-based compensation cost of $11.8&nbsp;million related to the cash receipt option and $2.2&nbsp;million related to the RSUs retention option. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2020, a RSU plan was put in place for certain of our executive officers. The vesting of these RSUs under the 2019 EIP requires the continuous service
of the employees through the vesting date, was originally subjected to the achievement of a market-condition target, and vesting occurs on the earliest of the following: (1)&nbsp;the occurrence of one of various events comprising a change in control
of the Company, (2)&nbsp;an initial public offering, or (3)&nbsp;the passage of time with the date being March&nbsp;9, 2026. At inception of the plan, the market condition target was tied to the valuation of the Company upon vesting. In September
2022, the Company modified the 2019 EIP to remove the market conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2019 EIP allows for either share or cash settlement of the RSUs at the
discretion of the Company&#146;s remuneration committee. Upon the occurrence of a change in control or an initial public offering, and at the discretion of the Company&#146;s remuneration committee, each RSU converts into one ordinary share on the
vesting date. Conversely, upon the passage of time, each RSU is settled in cash at the vesting date. For all periods presented, a change in control or an initial public offering is generally not considered probable until it has occurred.
Accordingly, the RSUs would only be settled in cash upon the passage of time and were accounted as liability-classified awards. Employees require continuous service until the passage of time and may elect not to participate in the 2019 EIP. RSUs are
settled in cash at the vesting date and neither carry rights to dividends nor voting rights. Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the RSUs vest. For all periods presented, the aggregate nominal amount of shares over which
the Company&#146;s remuneration committee may grant awards under the 2019 EIP will be limited so that it does not exceed at any time an amount equal to 0.3&nbsp;percent of the aggregate nominal amount of the Company&#146;s fully diluted equity share
capital. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 192,999, 903,925 and 2,214,568 RSUs were outstanding, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2022, the Company
modified the 2019 EIP to remove the market conditions which were tied to the valuation of the Company upon the vesting of the RSUs. All other terms under the 2019 EIP remained unchanged as a result of this modification and the RSUs remained as
liability-classified awards. The incremental share-based compensation cost was measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified RSUs over the fair value of the original RSUs immediately before their terms were modified at modification. As of
the modification date, incremental share-based compensation cost recognized was $4.5&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2022, the Company&#146;s remuneration
committee approved the cancellation of 355,463 outstanding RSUs issued to an executive participant under the 2019 EIP in exchange for a fixed monetary $20.0&nbsp;million </P>

measured by comparing the fair value of the award immediately before and after the modification. The Company accounted for this acceleration for the modification as a cumulative adjustment to the liability. As of the modification date, the net
incremental compensation cost for the modified award was $4.1&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,

March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022 were attributable to the replacement awards issued in December 2022 and executive departures, respectively. There were no tax impacts related to the 2019 EIP RSUs for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2022. For the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2022, the 2022 RSU Plan was established to grant RSUs to all employees of the Company (&#147;All Employee Awards&#148;). Employees may elect not to
participate in the plan. The RSUs vest in tranches, require continuous service through the vesting date and are subject to graded vesting over time. The 2022 RSU Plan provides vesting schedules applicable prior to and after an initial public
offering. For all periods, an initial public offering is generally not considered probable until it has occurred. Accordingly, the RSUs are currently probable of vesting based on the vesting schedule applicable prior to an initial public offering
over a three-year period and will vest by tranche through March 2025. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2022 RSU Plan allows for either cash or share settlement of the RSUs by tranche
at the discretion of the Company&#146;s remuneration committee. At the time of issuance, the Company intended to settle the RSUs in shares at the vesting date and such RSUs are accounted for as equity-classified awards. The Company recognizes share
based compensation cost using the straight-line method over the service period of the award except for performance grants with specific performance criteria, net of estimated forfeitures. These RSUs neither carry rights to dividends nor voting
rights until the shares are issued or transferred to the recipient. Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the RSUs vest. For all periods presented, the aggregate nominal amount of shares over which the Company&#146;s
remuneration committee may grant awards under the 2022 RSU Plan will be limited so that it does not exceed at any time an amount equal to 4.0&nbsp;percent of the aggregate nominal amount of the Company&#146;s fully diluted equity share capital. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company granted additional awards under the 2022 RSU Plan to new hires, starting in September 2022 (&#147;New Starter Awards&#148;). The New Starter
Awards share substantially the same terms as the existing RSUs for All Employee Awards with changes limited to the vesting schedules. The New Starter Awards require continuous service through each vesting date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company also granted additional RSUs to all employees and new hires of its subsidiary, Arm Israel, starting in February 2023 (the &#147;Israel
Awards&#148;). The Israel Awards share substantially have the same terms as the existing RSUs for All Employee Awards and New Starter Awards with changes limited to the vesting schedules. The Israel Awards require continuous service through the
vesting date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2022, the Company determined that it would settle the first tranche of the RSUs outstanding that vest in March and May 2023 by
paying cash instead of issuing equity. Other than the change in intent regarding form of settlement, no other terms or conditions regarding the RSUs were changed. The Company accounted for this change as a modification in accordance with ASC 718,
<I>Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation,</I> and reclassified the affected portion of the award from equity to liability and will remeasure the award at fair value at each reporting period through the date of settlement with consideration that total
compensation cost cannot be less than the grant-date fair-value-based measure of the original award. As a result of the modification, the Company recognized $2.1&nbsp;million of incremental share-based compensation cost at the time of the
modification and recorded $31.7&nbsp;million as a reclassification from equity to liability upon modification. 5,539 of employees were affected by this modification. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company had a United Kingdom corporate tax loss carryforward of $42&nbsp;million
($10&nbsp;million tax effected) and U.K. R&amp;D Expenditure Credits of $37&nbsp;million. These tax losses have no expiration date. The Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14&nbsp;million ($3&nbsp;million tax
effected) of which $1&nbsp;million has no expiration date and $13&nbsp;million ($3&nbsp;million tax effected) will expire between fiscal years 2033 and 2038 if not utilized. The Company also has a tax asset in respect of state net operating losses
of $46&nbsp;million ($3&nbsp;million net of federal benefit) which will expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2043 if not utilized. The Company has U.S. Federal tax credit carryforwards of $72&nbsp;million which will expire between 2035 and 2043. In
addition, the Company has state tax credits of $37&nbsp;million ($29&nbsp;million net of federal benefit) of which $22&nbsp;million has no expiration date and $15&nbsp;million will expire between 2037 and 2043. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company has provided a valuation allowance on certain U.K. tax losses and US State R&amp;D tax credits. This is based on an
analysis of historical taxable income, the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. The Company believes, more likely than not, that it will have sufficient taxable income to utilize its
remaining deferred tax assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Utilization of the U.S. federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due
to the ownership change limitations provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before
their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three-year period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $154&nbsp;million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its U.S.
subsidiaries and no deferred tax liability was recorded for these undistributed earnings. </P>

to litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While the results of any litigation or other legal proceedings are uncertain, management does not believe the ultimate resolution of any pending legal matters is likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company accrues for loss contingencies when it is both probable that it will incur the loss and when the Company can reasonably
estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. In the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company recorded a $40.0&nbsp;million loss contingency related to an offer made by the Company in respect of an ongoing contract dispute between the
Company and a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-top</FONT> five customer. That particular customer&#146;s claims arise from a contract dating to a very early period in the Company&#146;s history and that contract is both <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-standard</FONT> and significantly dissimilar from other customers&#146; contracts. The Company took into consideration advice received from experts in the specific matter and current status of settlement negotiations,
which may be ongoing. A complaint has not been filed by either party, and the Company and the customer are involved in ongoing negotiations to resolve the dispute outside of court. The Company can provide no assurances as to the ultimate resolution
of this dispute or whether it will ultimately be litigated or to the ultimate costs that will be associated with a resolution. The liability of $40.0&nbsp;million is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. No other
material amounts related to litigation settlements were recognized in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Kronos Guarantee
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2022, a wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary of SoftBank Group, Kronos I (UK) Limited (&#147;Kronos&#148;), was created for the purpose
of SoftBank Group arranging a facility agreement (the &#147;Facility Agreement&#148;) with J.P. Morgan SE as Facility Agent to be secured by its 75.01% equity interest in the Company. SoftBank Group pledged its ownership interest in the Company by
transferring such interest to an entity that sits between Kronos and the Company, and SoftBank Group has no further obligation under the Facility Agreement. The Company is in compliance with all applicable operating and financial covenants pursuant
to the Facility Agreement for the fiscal years presented. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Facility Agreement, the lenders initially were committed to make up to
$8.0&nbsp;billion of funds available to Kronos under a &#147;Bridge Facility&#148; and &#147;Term Facility&#148; (together with the Bridge Facility, the &#147;Facility&#148;). In March 2022, the Term Facility was funded for $7.1&nbsp;billion and the

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2022, an amendment was executed which expanded the total commitment of the Term Facility to
$8.5&nbsp;billion via an additional term facility of $1.4&nbsp;billion, $0.9&nbsp;billion of which was used to repay the Bridge Facility in full with the remaining $0.5&nbsp;billion representing incremental debt. The Term Facility matures on the
earlier of two years after Kronos draws upon the facility or three months after the effective date of a public listing of the Company&#146;s ordinary shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beyond the pledge of the 75.01% interest in the Company as collateral for the Facility, in March 2022, the Company entered into the Arm Undertaking (the
&#147;Undertaking&#148;) to confirm and agree to comply with certain terms of the Facility Agreement (including operational restrictions) and a springing guarantee and indemnity agreement (the &#147;Guarantee&#148;) with J.P. Morgan SE. The
Guarantee commences upon an &#147;Arm Guarantee Trigger Event,&#148; which includes a public listing of the Company&#146;s ordinary shares not occurring within 18 months of the closing date of the Facility or any public announcement or notice to
lenders that a listing will not be undertaken and failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with the obligations under the Undertaking. Until an Arm Guarantee Trigger Event occurs, the Company is not obligated to perform or make payment
on the obligations of Kronos. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an Arm Guarantee Trigger Event has occurred, the Company guarantees all overdue payments under the Facility Agreement.
The total commitment is $8.5&nbsp;billion and would only become a potential obligation to the Company if Kronos were to default on any such obligation, as Kronos remains the primary obligor under the Facility Agreement even after an Arm Guarantee
Trigger Event. Upon default, the lenders can satisfy their claim either through the collateral of 75.01% interest in the Company or through the Company servicing the debt and meeting payment obligations pursuant to the Guarantee. SoftBank Group as
the owner of Kronos may avoid default by restructuring the Facility Agreement, or otherwise monetizing the collateral for the necessary liquidity to meet payment obligations under the Facility Agreement. The Company believes that the likelihood of
assuming the debt obligations under the Guarantee is remote due to Kronos&#146; significant collateralization of the obligations under the Facility Agreement and that SoftBank Group will avoid a default by Kronos for which the obligations would
become enforceable against the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the Company&#146;s potential obligation is an issued Guarantee to the lenders for obligations of Kronos, an
entity under common control, the Company is not required to recognize the Guarantee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Arduino Guarantee </I></B></P>

compensation, impairment considerations for long-lived assets, fair value estimates and impairment for investments. The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and revises estimates as circumstances change. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience, anticipated results, trends, and other various assumptions that it believes are reasonable. Inputs used in judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of

investments in Acetone Limited, and Ampere. The Company initially computed the fair value for its investments consistent with the methodology and assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value with the assistance of
a third-party valuation specialist or based on inputs from the investee. The fair value computation is updated on a quarterly basis. The investments are classified within Level&nbsp;3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the
fair value of the investments using the (i)&nbsp;the market-calibration approach based on the guideline public company method and/or (ii)&nbsp;subject to availability of sufficient information, the income approach based on the discounted cash flow
method and iii) the probability-weighted, expected return (&#147;PWER&#148;) approach. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market-calibration approach considers valuation multiples that
are calibrated to the valuation as of the prior valuation date (i.e., quarterly) based on: (a)&nbsp;changes in the broader market or industry; (b)&nbsp;changes in the guideline public companies; and (c)&nbsp;changes in the company&#146;s operating
and financial performance. The fair value computation under this approach includes a key assumption for the range of valuation multiples (i.e., enterprise value or revenue), which requires significant professional judgment by the valuation
specialist and is based on observable inputs (e.g., market data) and unobservable inputs (e.g., market participant assumptions). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal quarters

Ampere. As of June&nbsp;30, 2023 and March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company has not converted any of its convertible promissory note into equity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair
value of the Ampere convertible loan is based upon significant unobservable inputs, including the use of a probability weighted discounted cash flows model, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Therefore, the Company has categorized
this asset as a Level&nbsp;3 financial asset. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the more significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the convertible loan
include applicable discount rates, the likelihood and projected timing of repayment or conversion, and projected cash flows in support of the estimated enterprise value of Ampere. Changes in these assumptions, while holding other inputs constant,
could result in a significant change in the fair value of the convertible loan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the amortized cost of the convertible loan exceeds its estimated fair
value, the security is deemed to be impaired, and must be evaluated for the recognition of credit losses. Impairment resulting from credit losses is recognized within earnings, while impairment resulting from other factors is recognized in other
comprehensive income (loss). As of June&nbsp;30, 2023 and March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company has not recognized any credit losses related to this convertible loan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value calculated using significant unobservable inputs did not differ materially from the amortized cost basis for the fiscal quarters ended
June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Currency Exchange Contracts </I></B></P>

share-based compensation cost, respectively, and $14.5&nbsp;million and $0.8&nbsp;million of tax benefit associated with these awards, respectively, As of June&nbsp;30, 2023 and March&nbsp;31, 2023, $194.4&nbsp;million and $114.2&nbsp;million was
recognized as a liability in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-current</FONT> portion of accrued compensation and share-based compensation on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2023, there was
$225.5&nbsp;million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to awards issued under the 2019 AEP expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the period starting from May 2022 through June 2022, the Company&#146;s remuneration committee modified the terms of the 2019 AEP to accelerate the
vesting for approximately 435 employees affected by restructuring activities initiated in the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022. The affected participants of the plan were provided the option to i) settle all unvested RSUs for a cash payment equivalent
to the product of (a)&nbsp;a fixed amount as determined by the remuneration committee (b) 50% of the number of RSUs held by the participant, or ii) retain the RSUs until they become vested pursuant to the original vesting terms. The Company
accounted for this acceleration as a modification of vesting in connection with a settlement which resulted in the recognition of incremental share-based compensation cost. For the fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2022, the Company recognized
incremental share-based compensation cost of $11.8&nbsp;million related to the cash receipt option and $2.2&nbsp;million related to the RSUs retention option, respectively. </P>

compensation cost of $0.3&nbsp;million in connection with the Phantom Shares for the fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2022, which was attributable to executive departures. There was no tax benefit or expense recorded for the Phantom Shares for the
fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2022. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, $1.1&nbsp;million was recognized in accrued compensation and benefits on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2023, the Company paid
$0.9&nbsp;million for the vested Phantom Shares. The variance between the amount accrued and paid of $1.1&nbsp;million and $0.9&nbsp;million, respectively, was driven by foreign exchange differences as participants were paid in foreign denominated
currencies. As of June&nbsp;30, 2023, the Company did not have any unpaid amounts in relation to the vested awards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Restricted Share Units &#150;

Company (&#147;All Employee Awards&#148;). The RSUs vest in tranches, require continuous service through the vesting date and are subject to graded vesting over time. The 2022 RSU Plan allows for either cash or share settlement of the RSUs by
tranche at the discretion of the Company&#146;s remuneration committee. At the time of issuance, the Company intended to settle the RSUs in shares at the vesting date and such RSUs were accounted for as equity-classified awards. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2022, the Company determined that it would settle the first tranche of the RSUs outstanding that vested in March and May 2023 by paying cash
instead of issuing equity. Other than the change in intent regarding form of settlement, no other terms or conditions regarding the RSUs were changed. The Company accounted for this change as a modification in accordance with ASC 718,
<I>Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation</I>, and reclassified the affected portion of the award from equity to liability and will remeasure the award at fair value at each reporting period through the date of settlement with consideration that total
compensation cost cannot be less than the grant-date fair-value-based measure of the original award. </P>

United Kingdom subsidiary of SoftBank Group, Kronos I (UK) Limited (&#147;Kronos&#148;), was created for the purpose of SoftBank Group arranging a facility agreement (the &#147;Facility Agreement&#148;) with J.P. Morgan SE as Facility Agent to be
secured by its equity interest in the Company. SoftBank Group pledged its ownership interest in the Company by transferring such interest to an entity that sits between Kronos and the Company, and SoftBank Group has no further obligation under the
Facility Agreement. The Company is in compliance with all applicable operating and financial covenants pursuant to the Facility Agreement for the periods presented. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Facility Agreement, the lenders initially were committed to make up to $8.0&nbsp;billion of funds available to Kronos under a &#147;Bridge
Facility&#148; and &#147;Term Facility&#148; (together with the Bridge Facility, the &#147;Facility&#148;). In March 2022, the Term Facility was funded for $7.1&nbsp;billion and the Bridge Facility was funded for $0.9&nbsp;billion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2022, an amendment was executed which expanded the total commitment of the Term Facility to $8.5&nbsp;billion via an additional term facility of
$1.4&nbsp;billion, $0.9&nbsp;billion of which was used to repay the Bridge Facility in full with the remaining $0.5&nbsp;billion representing incremental debt. The Term Facility matures on the earlier of two years after Kronos draws upon the
facility or three months after the effective date of a public listing of the Company&#146;s ordinary shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beyond the pledge of the interest in the
Company as collateral for the Facility, in March 2022, the Company entered into the Arm Undertaking (the &#147;Undertaking&#148;) to confirm and agree to comply with certain terms of the Facility Agreement (including operational restrictions) and a
springing guarantee and indemnity agreement (the &#147;Guarantee&#148;) with J.P. Morgan SE. The Guarantee commences upon an &#147;Arm Guarantee Trigger Event,&#148; which includes a public listing of the Company&#146;s ordinary shares not occurring
within 18 months of the closing date of the Facility or any public announcement or notice to lenders that a listing will not be undertaken and failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with the obligations under the Undertaking. Until an
Arm Guarantee Trigger Event occurs, the Company is not obligated to perform or make payment on the obligations of Kronos. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an Arm Guarantee Trigger
Event has occurred, the Company guarantees all overdue payments under the Facility Agreement. The total commitment is $8.5&nbsp;billion and would only become a potential obligation to the Company if Kronos were to default on any such obligation, as
Kronos remains the primary obligor under the Facility Agreement even after an Arm Guarantee Trigger Event. Upon default, the lenders can satisfy their claim either through the collateral of Kronos&#146; interest in the Company or through the Company
servicing the debt and meeting payment obligations pursuant to the Guarantee. SoftBank Group as the owner of Kronos may avoid default by restructuring the Facility Agreement, or otherwise monetizing the collateral for the necessary liquidity to meet
payment obligations under the Facility Agreement. The Company believes that the likelihood of assuming the debt obligations under the Guarantee is remote due to Kronos&#146; significant collateralization of the obligations under the Facility
Agreement and that SoftBank Group will avoid a default by Kronos for which the obligations would become enforceable against the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the
Company&#146;s potential obligation is an issued Guarantee to the lenders for obligations of Kronos, an entity under common control, the Company is not required to recognize the Guarantee. </P>

reorganization was solely for the purpose of reorganizing the Company&#146;s corporate structure, in which Arm Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of the holdings company, Arm Holdings plc. This transfer of equity resulted in the issuance of
ordinary shares of Arm Holdings plc to shareholders in the same class and same number of ordinary shares as their previous shareholding in Arm Limited. Because the corporate reorganization occurred between entities under common control, the
