wrote a single line of code, we visited the homes of many people like Yvette, a 29-year-old woman in suburban Atlanta struggling with obesity and prediabetes. We wanted to know what help people like her were getting to manage their conditions
between doctor's visits. The answer, most of the time, was: not much. As Yvette recounted, "I went in with a headache, and my doctor told me, you're prediabetic. You need to lose weight, you need to exercise. And I was just looking at him like,
really? This was only about a month ago. So I haven't wrapped my mind around it. I haven't taken any steps to do anything about it." 1 Many people told us that they had left their doctors' offices with little more than a pamphlet on healthy eating
and some general encouragement to shed a few pounds. Beyond that, they were on their own. The more than 156 million Americans living with chronic conditions, many with little or no proactive support, are the human voices of an epidemiological crisis
that we believe the American health care system is structurally unable to handle. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease alone cause or contribute up to 20% of U.S. deaths.2,3 These diseases are responsible for $526 billion in U.S. healthcare spend per
year, roughly 12% of total U.S. health care expenditures.4,5 This problem is only getting worse. 1 Testimonial is based on the individual's real experience and was gathered as part of user research for initial product development. The member was not
compensated for the testimonial or for time spent in providing the feedback, which was written by the member and not Omada. 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, High Blood Pressure Facts, last updated May 2024. 3 National Center for Health

 </P> <P ALIGN="center" STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.5pt"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The hard truth is that many of our country's billing, care, regulatory. and cultural models center around "the visit," a
notably ineffective mode of providing care for chronic needs. Doctors do their best in the narrow window of a visit to inspire change and improve health, but they are unable to do much for patients between visits-which is where most of life happens.
The results we're experiencing are the results we should expect: more illness and higher costs. This does not have to be our destiny. Between-Visit Care We launched Omada Health to be the anti-pamphlet. We're pioneering a new model of care we call
"Between-Visit Care," a novel approach to bringing together different types of healthcare professionals, an array of connected devices, and personalized software experiences in order to deliver multi-condition, contextually relevant care to our
members between their doctor's visits. This experience starts with our Care Teams, which are composed of skilled professionals like health coaches, certified diabetes care and education specialists, licensed clinical social workers, and licensed
physical therapists. These Care Teams get to know Omada members personally, helping them develop detailed, actionable care plans, encouraging and advising them when they struggle, and keeping an eye out for health heading in the wrong direction. We
also equip our members with seamlessly connected hardware, such as digital scales, blood pressure cuffs, blood glucose monitors, and continuous glucose monitors. We then tie the experience together with software that leverages data science advances
and artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. The user experience is designed to be simple, personalized, and engaging. When we connect with members to gather feedback and bring them to our town hall meetings to inspire us, we often
hear that our program feels so different from what they've experienced before. As one member told us: "I've been on every diet invented and heard every pep talk there is. But when I started Omada, it just felt different. On top of total
accountability with your weigh-ins (your weight is automatically sent to the app by the scale) the lessons are different. A couple of them truly set in and I'm able to apply daily and it has helped so much! I hit my first goal 2 weeks ahead of
schedule! My coach is amazing, I hear from her often and can always reach out to her for advice or help! This program is actually working!!"6 As we built Omada, we recognized that a different care model required a different operating model,
including go-to-market strategies, reimbursement structures, and technology platforms, so we designed new ones. We recognized the need to earn the trust of the clinical community. so we began publishing peer-reviewed research and earning
accreditations from respected authorities like the National Committee for Quality Assurance ("NCQA'') and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission ("URAC'). 6 Testimonial is based on the individual's real experience and results. We do not
claim these are typical results that members will achieve. Results may vary. This testimonial was gathered as part of user research for ongoing product development. The member was not compensated for the testimonial or for time spent in providing
the feedback, which was written by the member and not Omada. vii </FONT></P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P>

members' existing care, not replace it. We knew we needed to attract the sort of talent that cared deeply about our mission, so we shaped a values-driven culture. And we knew we needed to tend to the health of our financials as well as the health of
our members, so we have been thoughtful around our path to becoming a growing and dependable business. We're proud of our success so far. We've enrolled over one million members in Omada's care programs since launch. We now have 29 peer-reviewed
publications showing our clinical and economic impact. Roughly one in ten commercially insured adults in the U.S has coverage for an Omada program. We've partnered with more than 2,000 employers, health plans, and pharmacy benefit managers in
support of their employees or members with over 90% customer satisfaction7 and three-year average customer retention rate of over 90% as of December 31, 2024. As we have grown, our customers and channel partners have trusted us to serve broader
needs. In 2011, we began our journey in prediabetes and obesity. In 2018, we expanded to include diabetes and hypertension. And in 2020, we added musculoskeletal care. Now one in four of our customers work with Omada across multiple care areas.
We're also innovating alongside our customers and channel partners on new horizons, such as our GLP-1 Care Track, which aims to support the use of these valuable therapies in a manner that enhances clinical and economic value to both the members who
use the therapies and the health plans, employers, and other entities that often pay for them. Bending Disease Curves It has been an honor to lead Omada from a sketch on a white board to enrolling over one million members. And our journey is just
beginning. The size of our ambitions must reflect the size of the problem. Our hope is that, one day, tomorrow's epidemiologists will notice a bend in disease curves, wonder what might be happening, and conclude that part of that impact has been
Omada. In turn, our mission statement and purpose at Omada is to: Bend the curve To the Omadans both current and former, thank you for your incredible contributions and for bringing our dreams closer to reality each day. I hope you feel very proud.
Your past and continued efforts help to create the type of care that should exist for everyone but doesn't-yet. To our prospective shareholders, thank you for learning more about Omada. I invite you to join our journey. In front of us is a unique
chance to build a promising and successful business while truly changing lives. We are excited by the opportunity to partner with you, and view our investor relationships as just that - partnerships. Here's to a future where each passing day is a
better world for everyone living with chronic conditions. Onward and upward, Sean Duffy Co-Founder &amp; CEO 7 See the section titled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information

Mission </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Omada&#146;s mission is to bend the curve. Our hope is that, one day, tomorrow&#146;s epidemiologists will
notice a bend in disease curves, wonder what might be happening, and conclude that part of that impact has been Omada. As part of that mission, we strive to inspire and enable people to make lasting health changes on their own terms. We deliver
virtual care between doctor&#146;s visits, providing an engaging, personalized, and integrated experience for our members that is designed to improve their health while delivering value for the employers, health plans, health systems, pharmacy
benefit managers (&#147;PBMs&#148;), and other entities that cover the cost of our programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">As of 2022, more than 156&nbsp;million Americans suffered from one or more chronic conditions, such as obesity, prediabetes,
diabetes, hypertension, and musculoskeletal (&#147;MSK&#148;) conditions, and approximately 40% of U.S. adults suffered from two or more chronic conditions, based on data published in the Annals of Bioethics &amp; Clinical Applications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Managing these conditions&#151;and treating the acute problems they can lead to&#151;creates significant costs for employers,
health plans, PBMs, and other entities that pay for the cost of care. According to the American Diabetes Association (the &#147;ADA&#148;)&#146;s report &#147;Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. in 2022,&#148; chronic diseases were the leading
driver of U.S. medical spend, with diabetes alone accounting for $1 out of every $7 spent. According to research published in <I>Diabetes Care</I>, in 2022, an employee with type 2 diabetes cost on average an additional $7,000 annually due to
increased medical costs, absenteeism, and lost productivity. The direct medical cost of people living with diabetes increased by 35% from 2012 to 2022, despite stable diabetes prevalence. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">It doesn&#146;t have to be that way. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Many chronic conditions can be managed or prevented at a more reasonable cost. One reason these conditions are often not
managed efficiently is that the U.S. healthcare system was built mainly on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">encounter-based</FONT> reimbursement models that pay for specific services, primarily as issues arise. Between what can be short and
infrequent office visits, patients are often left to manage their condition on their own. Many have a hard time sticking to care plans and health goals&#151;losing weight, eating better, exercising more&#151;and have few resources to turn to for
ongoing questions, accountability, and support as they work to change their lifestyle. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Behavior change is hard. Omada was
created to make it easier. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Our virtual care programs are rooted in evidence and combine relationship-based, <FONT

programs for patients, and any other entity that is financially responsible for costs of our programs for a population of covered lives. We also work closely with health plans and PBMs that
either cover our programs for a portion of their members as our customers or act as channel partners reselling our programs to their own end customers. Our channel partners&#146; end customers typically consist of employers that cover our programs
for their employees and their dependents. In general, our customers cover the cost of our programs for our members, except that members in our physical therapy program may incur copays, coinsurance, or deductibles, depending on plan design, much
like in-person physical therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We launched our initial program in diabetes prevention and weight health in 2012, with
the goal of showing that a virtual program could achieve the same clinical results as its <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-person</FONT> archetype. Through feedback from our customers, channel partners, members, and the market at large, we then
recognized the need to create an integrated, multi-condition care platform to address multiple, commonly comorbid, chronic conditions. Today, we offer cardiometabolic programs for prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension; a physical therapy program
to address MSK conditions; additional support for members taking glucagon-like <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">peptide-1</FONT> agonists <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(&#147;GLP-1&#148;)</FONT> in our cardiometabolic programs (&#147;GLP-1 Care
Tracks&#148;); and behavioral health support across all programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Since our founding, our programs have had a meaningful,
positive impact. As of March&nbsp;31, 2025, we had more than 2,000 customers and over 679,000 total members enrolled in one or more programs, and we had supported over one million members since launch. We count a member as enrolled in a program to
the extent their participation was billed at least once in the preceding 12 months. We believe our programs serve a clear need for our customers and channel partners as well as our members, which is reinforced by our strong customer satisfaction and
member engagement rates. In 2024, our average customer satisfaction rate for the year was over 90% for each of program implementation and customer success. Our customer satisfaction rate is based on survey results from customers that launched a new
program during the measured period, and we consider a customer to be satisfied if they rated our program implementation and ongoing customer success, as applicable, at a 5 or higher on a 7-point scale. We believe that our customer satisfaction rates
are strong and reflect the value of our services to customers. See the section titled &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; for additional information on how we calculate our customer
satisfaction rate. In 2024, more than 55% of members still engaged with our cardiometabolic programs at least once per month after a year in the program, and over 50% still engaged monthly after two years. We consider members to be still engaged
after one year or two years in the program if, during their twelfth or twenty-fourth month of program participation in a cardiometabolic program, they complete at least one interaction with us, such as logging in or interacting with the Omada mobile
app, sending messages to Omada Care Team members, or recording metrics such as weight, blood pressure, or blood glucose values. On average, in 2024, members in a cardiometabolic program engaged more than 30 times per month throughout their first
year. Based on our experience and feedback from customers, we believe these engagement rates to be positive and to demonstrate the attractiveness of our program to members. We are proud of our progress, and we are just getting started. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We have experienced strong growth since our inception. Revenue increased by 38% from $122.8&nbsp;million to
$169.8&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and by 57% from $35.1 million to $55.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. We continue to generate revenue from recurring
customers, as evidenced by our net dollar retention rate, which for customers who were contracted as of the beginning of the prior period, is calculated as total billings generated in a particular period divided by total billings generated in the
prior period and was 110% and 128% for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. We have a history of net losses, due in part to the significant investments we have made in the design and development of our programs and platform
enhancements, and have not yet achieved profitability on an annual basis. We incurred net losses of $67.5&nbsp;million and $47.1 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $19.0 million and $9.4&nbsp;million for
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $396.8&nbsp;million and $444.0 million, respectively. As of March&nbsp;31, 2024 and 2025, we had an

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Chronic condition prevalence has been rising for more than two decades and continues to rise. A RAND study from 2015 estimated
that more than 170&nbsp;million Americans could be living with one or more chronic conditions by 2030. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the &#147;CDC&#148;), in 2023, chronic conditions were responsible for seven of every
ten deaths in the U.S. and accounted for 90%, or $3.8 trillion, of annual medical spend in the U.S. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Many Digital Health Solutions
Have Fallen Short in Attempts to Address Chronic Conditions </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">For more than a decade, digital health and virtual
care solutions have promised to use technology to deliver greater access, lower costs, and provide a superior patient experience. While some gains have been made, when it comes to improving outcomes for those living with or at risk for chronic
conditions, we believe many digital chronic condition management platforms have not meaningfully changed the trajectory. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our Market
Opportunity </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">People with chronic health conditions are the largest and highest-cost populations in the entire U.S.
healthcare system. Our primary target population comprises individuals covered by commercial health insurance, which we define as employer-sponsored health insurance, including both self-funded plans administered by health plans and populations that
are fully insured by health plans, but excluding individuals covered only by government programs, such as Medicare Advantage, or through PBMs and health systems, where those individuals are not also covered by the commercial health insurance
described above. According to a 2024 report from KFF, this target population covered by commercial health insurance is composed of approximately 154&nbsp;million individuals. Of this target population, we estimate that, as of December 31, 2024,
approximately 18&nbsp;million individuals had access to one or more Omada programs through these commercial health insurance providers and the remainder either had health insurance coverage through commercial health insurance providers that did not
cover Omada programs at all or as part of populations that our current customers did not cover for our programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">For
purposes of illustrating the market opportunity available to us, we assume we could capture the entirety of the target population with prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, and MSK conditions. The estimates of our market opportunity for individuals
with prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, and MSK conditions rely on data across each condition for the U.S. population as a whole and therefore assume that these conditions do not vary by geography. Because our members are geographically diverse
and all reside in the U.S., we believe national data is representative of the target population. If in the future our members are no longer limited to the U.S. or cease to be geographically diverse within the U.S., our calculations would be
correspondingly affected. Our estimates for prediabetes, hypertension, and MSK conditions are based on available data that is not age-group specific, although the data used for prediabetes and hypertension is limited to adults. Accordingly, our
estimates do not account for how prevalence rates for prediabetes, hypertension, and MSK conditions may vary across age groups. Because our estimates for diabetes are based on available data from the CDC that is age-group specific, the estimates for
diabetes utilized different prevalence rates across age groups based on that information. If estimates for the prevalence of U.S. individuals with prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, or MSK conditions change, including, where used in our estimates,
by age group, our calculations would be affected correspondingly. </P>

weight health and into other conditions, such as the treatment and management of diabetes, hypertension, and MSK conditions. Based on the significant overlap across these chronic conditions, we believed there was an opportunity to better meet
members where they were: often suffering from multiple comorbid conditions at once. Our coordinated, multi-condition experience allows us to tailor care plans to members based on their comorbidities, which can be a major advantage in achieving
clinical outcomes and a positive member experience. Many of our customers and channel partners also appreciate having a single partner for chronic condition care because it can simplify contracting, account management, implementation, and member

the U.S. were living with two or more chronic conditions, which can leave many individuals to struggle with a healthcare system that treats each one of their issues separately. The CDC reported in 2023 that people with diabetes were more than twice
as likely to experience depression; a 2019 study published in the <I>Journal of Back and Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation</I> found that 58% of people with diabetes also experienced an MSK condition; and a 2021 study published in <I>Endotext</I> found
that approximately 74% of adults with diabetes also had hypertension. We have carefully selected the conditions that we treat in an effort to address significant areas of comorbidity in an integrated member experience with one provider. We are able
to deliver care to members diagnosed with prediabetes, obesity, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and hypertension; members taking <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> therapy; and members who suffer from MSK conditions. Additionally, all members
may receive additional support for behavioral health challenges from anxiety or stress to depression to promote overall wellbeing and support their physical and mental health. </P>

unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and include, in management&#146;s opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
that they consider necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information set forth in those statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future, and results for
the three months ended March 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ended December 31, 2025. You should read the following summary consolidated financial data together with our audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and, in each case, the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus and the section titled &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.&#148; The summary consolidated financial data included in this section are not intended to replace the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. </P>

growth has placed significant demands on our management and financial, operational, technological, and other resources, and we expect that any future growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will
require us to continue developing and improving our financial, operational, and other internal controls. In particular, continued growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas, including recruiting and retaining sufficient skilled
personnel, providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards, and preserving our culture and values. We may not be able to address these challenges in a cost-effective manner, or at all. As we grow, we may also need
to invest significant resources to improve and expand our technological systems, including reworking any existing technology and/or documenting existing features, and we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective manner or at all. If we are unable
to efficiently update or further improve our technology infrastructure, we may need to hire additional personnel, including Care Team members, to support our programs and any future growth, which could limit our ability to achieve economies of
scale. If we do not effectively manage our growth, we may not be able to execute on our business plan, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy requirements from our customers and channel partners, or
maintain high-quality offerings, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. </P>

increased utilization of virtual-first care services, but long-term demand for virtual care is uncertain. Our future financial performance will depend in part on growth in this market and on our
ability to adapt to emerging demands of our customers and channel partners. It is difficult to predict the future growth rate and size of our target market. The forecasts that we use to anticipate expected growth for our business and revenue rely on
assumptions and metrics that are difficult to estimate accurately, including but not limited to anticipated enrollment rates, our number of enrolled members, our ability to secure and retain business from new customers and channel partners or to
secure additional business from additional customers and channel partners, the anticipated timing of securing that business, member engagement levels in our programs, and member outcomes from our programs, and our assumptions and estimates may not
be accurate. In addition, the estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail
to grow at similar rates, if at all. Negative publicity concerning our programs or our market as a whole could limit market acceptance of our programs. If our existing or potential customers, channel partners, and members do not perceive the
benefits of our programs, or if our programs do not drive member enrollment, then our market may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of existing and
potential customers to increase their coverage of and support for our programs and our ability to demonstrate the value of our programs to our existing and potential customers and channel partners. If these entities do not recognize or acknowledge
the benefits of our programs or if we are unable to reduce healthcare costs or drive positive health outcomes, then the market for our programs might not develop at all, or it might develop more slowly than we expect. Similarly, negative publicity
or negative customer or member sentiment regarding patient confidentiality, data privacy, AI, and cybersecurity in the context of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">technology-enabled</FONT> healthcare or concerns experienced by us or our competitors
could limit market acceptance of our programs. We face additional risks related to cybersecurity. See the risk factor titled &#147;<I>Our information technology (&#147;IT&#148;) systems and those of our affiliated professional entities, or those
used by our third-party service providers, vendors, business partners, or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer cybersecurity incidents, data breaches, and other disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of our systems
or programs, compromise confidential information related to our business or of our customers or channel partners, including protected health information (&#147;PHI&#148;) and other sensitive or personal information of employees, covered individuals,
and members, or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability or otherwise materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects</I>&#148; and other risks

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The healthcare industry in the U.S. is undergoing significant structural change and is rapidly evolving. We believe demand for
our programs has been driven in large part by rapidly growing costs in the traditional healthcare system, the movement toward patient-centricity and more personalized healthcare, and advances in technology. Widespread acceptance of personalized
healthcare is critical to our future growth and success. A reduction in the growth of personalized healthcare could reduce the demand for our programs and result in a lower revenue growth rate or decreased revenue. Additionally, we sell our programs
using innovative pricing models, primarily charging for members who enroll and engage rather than at a population level, and the adoption of these models is still relatively new, especially in the healthcare industry. If companies do not shift to
these types of models and these models do not achieve widespread adoption, or if there is a reduction in demand for products and services using models such as these, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be

expect it to attract increased competition. We currently face competition from a range of digital health companies, including direct competition from competitors offering cardiometabolic programs, such as Hello Heart Inc., Lark Technologies, Inc.,
Livongo (via Teladoc Health, Inc.), Onduo LLC, Vida Health, Inc., and Virta Health Corp.; competitors offering only MSK programs, such as Hinge Health, Inc. and SWORD Health, Inc.; and those that offer both cardiometabolic and MSK programs, such as
DarioHealth Corp. In some cases, our competitors also include enterprise companies that are focused on or may enter the healthcare industry generally, including initiatives and partnerships launched by these large companies, and those that offer
point solutions for a single chronic condition. These companies, which may offer their solutions at lower prices, are continuing to develop additional products and becoming more sophisticated and effective. In addition, large, well-financed
healthcare providers and health plans have in some cases developed their own platforms or tools and may provide these solutions at discounted prices. Competition from specialized software providers or device manufacturers, which may facilitate the
collection of data but offer limited interpretation, feedback, or guidance, and other parties will result in continued pricing pressures, which are likely to lead to price declines in certain product areas, which could negatively impact our sales,
profitability, and market share. Consumer technology companies may also offer solutions that feature health coaching, health advice, or other health services that may affect the demand for our programs. In addition, healthcare providers may choose
not to implement a digital health solution at all and instead may continue to rely on traditional, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-person</FONT> approaches to healthcare. Moreover, our programs and systems are designed to comply with rules and
regulations applicable to healthcare providers, and as a result, we must enter into contracts that appropriately reflect the obligations of a healthcare provider, including data privacy and healthcare regulatory requirements. We compete with
wellness vendors whose products and services are not designed to comply with these rules and regulations and therefore may be preferred by potential customers and channel partners who view our programs and related healthcare provider requirements as
overly complex or otherwise undesirable. The loss of potential customers and channel partners as a result of our status as a healthcare provider may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Some of our competitors may have, or new competitors or alliances may emerge that have, greater name and brand
recognition, greater market share, a larger customer base, more or larger channel partner relationships, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise, larger sales forces, longer operating histories, or significantly
greater resources than we do and may be able to offer solutions similar to ours at a more attractive price than we can, or may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. In addition, our competitors have established, and may in

If we are unable to establish, maintain, or grow these relationships over time or if customers or channel partners refer business to our competitors instead, we are likely to fail to recover these costs and our results of operations and prospects
will suffer. The loss of any of our key customers or channel partners could negatively impact our revenue as we work to obtain new customers or establish replacement channel partner relationships. Contracts with our key customers and channel
partners may be terminated before their term expires for various reasons, subject to certain conditions. For example, most of our contracts are terminable for convenience by our customers and channel partners, subject to a notice period. Certain
contracts may be terminated immediately by the customer or channel partner if we go bankrupt, if we lose applicable licenses or are suspended or debarred from participation in government-funded healthcare programs, or if we fail to comply with

relationship. Additionally, mergers and acquisitions involving us, our customers, our channel partners, or their competitors could lead to cancellation or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-renewal</FONT> of our contracts with those customers or
channel partners or by the acquiring or combining companies, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential customers, channel partners, and members. Acquisitions involving our customers or channel partners could also lead to a loss of
customers, channel partners, or members if we are not contracted, or are unable to obtain a contract, with the acquiring company or its benefit providers or channel partners. In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to
depend on our relationships with third parties, including our channel partners. Identifying channel partners and negotiating and documenting relationships with them requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be effective in
providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce enrollments in, or utilization of, our programs. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our
ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our results of operations and prospects may suffer. Even if we are successful, these relationships may not result in increased use of our programs by customers,

by improving our member outreach, engagement, and enrollment methodology, hiring and training qualified professionals, and increasing our ability to integrate into large-scale, complex technology environments. In some cases, customers and channel
partners initially enter into an agreement with us for one or more of our programs, but, for a variety of potential reasons, covered individuals fail to ultimately enroll at the expected volume. For example, the conditions that our programs address
may be less prevalent among the covered individuals than we expect and/or our customers and channel partners may provide limited contact information for outreach campaigns or otherwise not adequately enable or permit outreach campaigns to covered
individuals generally or at our preferred timing. In addition, we rely on email outreach to enroll covered individuals, and from time to time, the interfaces, features, or policies of email applications, email service providers, mobile device
operating systems, or other relevant software are altered or updated, which may adversely impact our ability to effectively reach covered individuals to facilitate their enrollment, and as a result, could materially and adversely affect member
enrollment rates. For these and other reasons, our forecasts may not accurately estimate enrollment rates or the number of enrolled members. For additional information on the assumptions we rely on to anticipate expected growth for our business and
revenue, see the risk factor titled &#147;<I>The market for our programs is new, rapidly evolving, and increasingly competitive, as the healthcare industry in the</I> <I>U.S. is undergoing significant structural change, which makes it difficult to
forecast demand for our programs</I>.&#148; If we are unable to achieve the expected volume of member enrollment, or unable to do so in a timely manner, customers and channel partners are unlikely to renew their agreements with us and/or expand
their agreements with us to include additional programs, and we would not be able to generate future revenue from those relationships, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely

for outreach campaigns or are unwilling or unable to enable outreach campaigns generally, or if enrollment launch dates are delayed, we could fail to meet our enrollment and revenue expectations, which may adversely impact our business, financial

hypertension, musculoskeletal conditions, and our programs, these estimates may not be correct, and the conditions supporting our estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result,
our estimates of the total addressable market for our programs may prove to be incorrect. In addition, changes in underlying causes or risk factors for the conditions that our programs address, such as the impact of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> drugs on obesity, could impact our estimates of the total addressable market. If the actual number of members who would benefit from our programs and the total addressable market for our programs is

act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our ability to deliver our programs. The facilities also could be subject to <FONT

is critical to our success. We may experience material interruptions, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems to our systems as a result of third-party data centers and hosting providers, including AWS, SaaS companies, or other vendors.
Because our programs are used by our members to manage chronic conditions, it is critical that our programs and related connected devices be accessible without significant interruption or degradation of performance. Members may become dissatisfied
by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our programs to them or that impacts the functionality of the connected devices provided in connection with our programs. Outages could lead to the triggering of our service-level
agreements or performance guarantees and the issuance of repayments to our customers and channel partners, in which case, we may not be fully indemnified for such losses pursuant to our agreement with AWS, SaaS providers, or other vendors. We may
not be able to easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of AWS. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our programs to customers, channel
partners, and members and result in contract terminations, thereby reducing revenue and harming our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could
damage our reputation and may adversely impact use and adoption of our programs. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our ability
to deliver our programs. To the extent we do not effectively respond to any such interruptions, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate traffic, our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, our disaster recovery systems and those of third parties with which we do business may not function as intended or may fail to adequately protect our
critical business information in the event of a significant business interruption, which may cause cybersecurity breaches or the loss of data or functionality and could, in turn, lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition

deliver only educational resources, recommendations, or support, in each case, for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle. We anticipate making significant investments to continuously improve our use of such technologies. There are
significant risks involved in the development and deployment of AI technologies, and there can be no assurance that our or our third-party service providers&#146; or partners&#146; use of these technologies will perform as expected, enhance our
products or services, or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. For example, the continued use of any AI technologies in our products and services, or those of our third-party service providers and partners, may
give rise to risks related to, among other things, inaccurate, biased, or harmful recommendations, data privacy, confidentiality, cybersecurity and data provenance concerns, new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We face significant competition from other companies with respect to
utilizing AI technologies. To the extent AI technology development and utilization from our industry competitors proves to be successful, or more successful than our approach, demand for our programs, and thus our business, could be adversely
affected. If we cannot develop, offer, or deploy new AI technologies as effectively, as quickly, and/or as cost-effectively as our competitors, or if we cannot access the infrastructure needed to continue our development, our operating results,
relationships with customers and channel partners, and growth could be materially and adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The rapid
evolution of AI technologies will require the application of resources to develop, test, maintain, and improve our programs to help ensure that the AI technologies are, and remain, accurate and efficient. We expect our AI technology initiatives will
over time require increased investment in technology infrastructure and may require additional specialized headcount. The continuous development, testing, maintenance, and deployment of our AI technologies may also increase the cost profile of our
offerings and may involve unforeseen difficulties including material performance problems, undetected defects, or errors. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we may discover additional problems that may prevent our AI
technologies from operating properly, which could adversely affect our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The regulatory framework for AI is
rapidly evolving, and many federal, state, and foreign governmental bodies and agencies have introduced and/or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. The Trump Administration has rescinded an executive order relating to the safe
and secure development and deployment of AI technologies that was previously implemented by the Biden Administration. The Trump Administration then issued a new executive order that, among other things, requires certain agencies to develop and
submit to the President action plans to &#147;sustain and enhance America&#146;s global AI dominance,&#148; and to specifically review all rulemaking taken pursuant to the rescinded Biden executive order and, if possible, rescind any such rulemaking
to the extent it is inconsistent with, or presents a barrier to, the Trump Administration&#146;s new executive order. Thus, the Trump Administration may continue to rescind other existing federal orders and/or administrative policies relating to AI
technologies or may implement new executive orders and/or other rulemaking relating to AI technologies in the future. Any such changes at the federal level could require us to expend significant resources to modify our programs, services, or
operations to ensure compliance or remain competitive. U.S. legislation related to AI technologies has also been introduced at the federal level and is advancing at the state level. For example, the California Privacy Protection Agency is currently
in the process of finalizing regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2018 (collectively, the &#147;CCPA&#148;), regarding the use of automated decision-making and providing
disclosures to consumers regarding such use. California also enacted several new laws in 2024 that further regulate use of AI technologies and provide consumers with additional protections around companies&#146; use of AI technologies, such as
requiring companies to disclose certain uses of generative AI. Other states have also passed AI-focused legislation, such as Colorado&#146;s Artificial Intelligence Act, which will require developers and deployers of &#147;high-risk&#148;
AI&nbsp;systems to implement certain safeguards against algorithmic discrimination, and Utah&#146;s Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, which establishes disclosure requirements and accountability measures for the use of generative AI in certain
consumer interactions. New laws, rules, directives, and regulations governing AI technologies and changes to existing ones may adversely affect the ability of our business to use or rely on certain AI technologies. Implementation standards and
enforcement practice are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or perception of their requirements may have on our programs and our business. We may not
always be able to anticipate how to respond to these new or updated laws or regulations, and they may affect our ability to use AI technologies. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations, or decisions and/or guidance interpreting
existing laws, including the redesign of our platform or programs to achieve compliance, could be significant and could increase our operating expenses, and we may be at increased risk of claims against us. Any actual or perceived failure to comply
with evolving regulatory frameworks around the development and use of AI technologies could materially and adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. </P>

large portion of our revenue from our arrangements with customers that purchase healthcare for their employees (via insurance or self-funded benefit plans), either through direct contracts with us or through our relationships with our channel
partners, including health plans, PBMs, and other resellers. These customers provide benefits for all or a portion of their employees who, in turn, may become eligible members. A large part of the demand for our programs among customers depends on
the need of these employers to manage the costs of healthcare services that they pay on behalf of their employees. Various factors, including changes in the healthcare insurance market or in government regulation of the healthcare industry, could
cause a decline in employer-sponsored healthcare, which could adversely affect the market for our programs and negatively affect our business and results of operations. Some experts have predicted that future healthcare reform will encourage
employer-sponsored health insurance to become significantly less prevalent as employees migrate to obtaining their own insurance over state-sponsored insurance marketplaces. Other changes or developments in U.S. health insurance markets, including
efforts to create a single-payer or government-run health insurance program, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. If any of these changes were to occur, there is no
guarantee that we would be able to compensate for the loss in revenue derived from customers by increasing member acquisition through other channels, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and
adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><B><I>Our sales and implementation cycle can be long and unpredictable and requires considerable time and expense. As
a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of
our sales cycle, particularly with respect to large organizations and government entities. The sales cycle for our programs from initial contact with a potential customer or channel partner to member enrollment launch varies widely, ranging in some
cases to over a year. Some of our customers and channel partners, especially in the case of large organizations and government entities, undertake a significant and prolonged evaluation process, including to determine whether our programs meet their
unique healthcare needs, which frequently involves evaluation of not only our programs but also other available solutions, which results in extended sales cycles. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers and channel partners about the ease
of use, technical capabilities, and potential benefits of our programs. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities, which lowers our operating margins, particularly if no sale occurs. For example,
there may be unexpected delays in the internal procurement processes of our customers and channel partners, particularly for some larger organizations and government entities for which our programs represent a small percentage of their total
procurement activity. There are many other customer-specific factors that contribute to the timing of purchases and resulting timing of our revenue recognition, including the strategic importance of a particular project to a customer or channel
partner, budgetary constraints, funding authorization, and changes in their personnel. In addition, the significance and timing of our program enhancements and the introduction of new products or solutions by our competitors may also affect
purchases. Even if a customer or channel partner decides to purchase our programs, there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue, which makes our revenue difficult to forecast. For example, once a customer or channel
partner enters into an agreement with us, we work with them to identify the eligible population and then launch an enrollment process. Time from signing to launch typically takes an average of approximately three months. As part of the enrollment
process, we incur significant expense explaining the benefits of our programs again to potential members to encourage them to enroll. We do not receive any payment from our customers or channel partners until members enroll and begin using our
programs, which could be months following signing an agreement for our programs. Moreover, our contracts with customers and channel partners generally may provide that some fees are subject to repayment if certain clinical outcomes or other
performance criteria are not met. For all of these reasons, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular period in which a sale will be completed, the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized, or the
amount of revenue that we will ultimately recognize. </P>

introductions and enhancements, changing demands from customers and channel partners, updates to clinical guidelines and best practices, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of new drugs, changes in clinical guidelines or healthcare
benefits, or the evolution of products and services embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable. In particular, the rapid pace of innovation in AI and machine learning can lead to the
development of new, improved, or more cost-effective solutions that could render our programs and offerings less competitive or obsolete. Additionally, changes in laws and regulations could impact the usefulness of our programs and could necessitate
changes or modifications to our programs to accommodate such changes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We invest substantial resources in researching and
developing new programs and enhancing our programs and platform by incorporating additional features, improving functionality, and adding other improvements to meet market demands and our members&#146; evolving needs. The success of any enhancements
or improvements to our platform, programs, or any new programs depends on several factors, including timely completion, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with new and existing technologies in our programs platform and
third-party partners&#146; technologies, clinical results, cost effectiveness, and overall market acceptance. Our development of programs also depends on rights or interests in certain intellectual property, which we or third parties on which we
rely may own or license. We may not succeed in developing, marketing, and delivering on a timely and cost-effective basis enhancements or improvements to our platform, programs, or any new programs that respond to continued changes in market demands
or new requirements from customers or channel partners, and any enhancements or improvements to our platform, programs, or any new programs may not achieve market acceptance or may otherwise be negatively impacted by third-party actions that are
outside of our control. For example, we have developed <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> Care Tracks to support members who are engaged in one of our cardiometabolic programs to enable their success before, during, and after <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> therapy. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> therapeutic space is new and rapidly evolving, and actions by employers, health plans, PBMs, pharmaceutical companies, and other third parties,
including federal, state, or local governments, could negatively impact the adoption of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> Care Tracks. For example, if pharmaceutical companies restrict cost rebates or other incentives for <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1s</FONT> for employers who place conditions on the use of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1s</FONT> (such as participation in our program), market acceptance of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT>
Care Tracks could be materially and adversely affected. Conversely, certain health plans, PBMs, employers, or other customers or channel partners may require that members enroll in, and engage with, one of our GLP-1 Care Tracks as a condition of
receiving GLP-1 prescriptions. When health plans, PBMs, employers, or other customers or channel partners require that members enroll in, and engage with, one of our GLP-1 Care Tracks as a condition of receiving GLP-1 prescriptions, we may provide
data reporting that those customers and channel partners use in their review or adjudication of prescription requests. If our data reporting systems or processes are delayed, disrupted, or otherwise fail to work as intended, the prescription
processes of our customers and channel partners may be negatively affected, which may result in delayed prescriptions, which in turn could cause member harm or materially and adversely impact our relationships with customers and channel partners.
Although, as of December 31, 2024, FDA-approved labels guided that GLP-1 therapies prescribed in adults for obesity or chronic weight management should be prescribed concurrently with a behavioral and lifestyle treatment plan, members could react
negatively to these requirements. Although these conditions are not imposed by Omada directly, members could nevertheless attribute these requirements to us and develop a negative perception of us or our programs and our business, which could harm
our brand and reputation. Moreover, if the use of GLP-1 therapy for weight loss receives negative publicity and/or one or more GLP-1s are determined to be harmful, the use of GLP-1s for weight loss could decline, which would reduce demand for our
GLP-1 Care Tracks and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. </P>

may delay making purchases of new programs to permit them to make a more thorough evaluation of these programs or until industry and marketplace reviews become widely available. Some customers or channel partners may hesitate to migrate to a new

including bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs, inadvertent exposure of confidential information or security incidents arising from human or technological error, and other causes of security vulnerabilities could be significant, and
while we have implemented certain cybersecurity measures designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of confidential information and our IT systems, including from system failure, accident, and security breach, there can be
no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes will be fully implemented, complied with, or effective. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not
recognized until launched against a target, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches. We may
also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. Any security incident or other adverse impact to the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of our information systems or confidential information could result
in unexpected interruptions, delays, disruption of our programs and our business operations, cessation of service, negative publicity and reputational impacts, significant financial liability to our members, customers, channel partners, regulators,
or others, loss of customers or channel partners, loss of members, and other harm to our business and our competitive position, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other disruptions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We and certain of our third-party service providers and vendors are from time to time subject to cyberattacks and security
incidents. For example, Delta Dental of California and affiliates, a dental insurance carrier for employees enrolled in our self-insured ERISA plan, was impacted by a security incident in May 2023 resulting from a vulnerability in a third-party file
transfer software, MOVEit, that compromised certain of our employees&#146; personal information, but did not materially impact our business or operations. Further, in February 2024,&nbsp;Change Healthcare, an insurance claims processing vendor,
experienced a cyberattack forcing the shutdown of its claims processing systems and potentially exposing sensitive data (the &#147;Change Healthcare Incident&#148;). Based on information shared to date, we do not believe the Change Healthcare
Incident has materially affected our business, operations, or data. We do, however, rely on similar service providers and clearinghouses to process eligibility for certain of our members and their claims. Any cybersecurity incident, outage, or
interruption impacting the systems of such service providers and clearinghouses could result in delays in our ability to process insurance claims, collect payments, and confirm insurance eligibility for members and require us to turn to alternative
channels for such services, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or be able to be accessed or implemented in a timely manner. While we do not believe that we have experienced any significant system failure, accident, or
security breach to date, if we, our affiliated professional entities, service providers, vendors, business partners, other contractors, or consultants were to experience a significant cybersecurity breach of our or their IT systems or data or other
significant cybersecurity incident, the costs associated with the incident response, investigation, system restoration or remediation, notification to customers and channel partners, regulators, and others, and future compliance costs could be
material. In addition, our remediation efforts, or those of our vendors or service providers, may not be successful. Any cybersecurity incident affecting us, our affiliated professional entities, service providers, vendors, business partners, other
contractors, consultants, or our industry, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and lead to regulatory scrutiny. We could incur or be exposed to potential liability,
including class action and other litigation exposure. There can be no assurance that provisions typically included in our terms with members or in our agreements with our customers and channel partners that attempt to limit exposure to legal claims
would be enforceable or adequate or would protect us from liabilities or damages. Even if a claim is not successful, any claim brought against us would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend and could seriously damage our reputation, brand,
or business. Any cybersecurity incident affecting us could also subject us to regulatory action, investigation, or enforcement action, any of which could potentially result in penalties, fines, and significant legal liability. In addition, our
competitive position could be harmed, and the further development and commercialization of our programs could be delayed. Any or all of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
prospects. </P>

certain cybersecurity incidents and data breaches. Most jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities, and others (including, in certain cases, the media) of cybersecurity incidents or data
breaches involving certain types or quantities of data. For example, following the completion of this offering, we will be subject to an increasing number of reporting obligations in respect of material cybersecurity incidents. These reporting
requirements have been proposed or implemented by a number of regulators in different jurisdictions, may vary in their scope and application, and could contain conflicting requirements. Certain of these rules and regulations may require us to report
a cybersecurity incident before we have been able to fully assess its impact, or contain and remediate the underlying issue. Efforts to comply with such reporting requirements could divert management&#146;s attention from our incident response and
could potentially reveal system vulnerabilities to threat actors. Failure to timely report incidents under these rules could also result in monetary fines, sanctions, or subject us to other forms of liability. Such mandatory disclosures are costly,
could lead to negative publicity, may cause our customers, channel partners, or members to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, or alleviate
problems caused by, the actual or perceived cybersecurity incident or data breach and otherwise comply with the multitude of foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of,
personal information (including PHI). Because we utilize third-party vendors and service providers, such as AWS and other cloud services that support our member-facing mobile and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">web-based</FONT> applications,
customer-facing aspects of our platform, and our own internal operations, successful cyberattacks that disrupt or result in unauthorized access to third-party IT systems can materially impact our operations and financial results. Such third parties,
and the services they provide, which may be outside of our direct control, are subject to the same risk of experiencing, and have experienced, outages, other failures, and security breaches described above. Further, if we or our third-party vendors
or service providers fail to detect or remediate in a timely manner a cybersecurity incident or an incident that otherwise affects a large amount of data of one or more customers or channel partners, or if we suffer an incident that impacts our
ability to operate our programs, we may suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. </P>

incurred in relation to a cybersecurity incident or data breach, including indemnification obligations or other liabilities. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to
be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Our risks are likely to increase as we continue to expand our platform, grow the number of customers, channel partners, and members that we serve,

other business partners could attempt to cancel their contracts with us, or our members could disenroll from our programs. There can be no assurance that provisions typically included in our agreements with customers, channel partners, or other

intellectual property and our competitive position. However, the patent positions of technology and virtual care companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the scope, validity, and
enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurances that any of our issued patents have included, or that any of our currently pending or future patent applications
that mature into issued patents will include, claims with a scope that meaningfully protects our programs. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be
advantageous to us. Additionally, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, and any patents issued to us may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held unenforceable, or circumvented, or
may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing programs similar in design to our programs. Such proceedings could include supplemental examination or contested post-grant proceedings such as review, reexamination,
interference, or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights. Further, patent protection must ultimately be sought on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">country-by-country</FONT></FONT> basis, which is an

defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged

prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties also may raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the U.S. or abroad, even
outside the context of litigation. Mechanisms for such challenges include <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-examination,</FONT> post-grant review,<I></I><I>&nbsp;inter partes</I>&nbsp;review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and

With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity

instead award only monetary damages, which may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.
Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. </P>

parties may claim that they infringe, intellectual property rights covered by patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the U.S. and
abroad. These third parties may bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement or other intellectual
property-related lawsuit is brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay sales of the program that is the subject of the suit. From time to time, we may receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. As
the market for digital health solutions in the U.S. expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products and technology of which we are not aware or that we must
challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property lawsuits could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. An
adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities such as monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees if we are found to have
willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. Further, we may be required to redesign the applicable technology in a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringing</FONT> manner, which may not be commercially feasible. As a
result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay significant license fees, royalties or both. Licenses may not be available on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all, in which event our business would be materially and adversely affected. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the

The terms of certain open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or
restrictions on our platform, including requiring us to disclose our proprietary source code to the public. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our
proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such a use could inadvertently occur, or could be claimed to have occurred, in part because open source license terms can be ambiguous. Additionally, we
could face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding the release of, any open source software or derivative works that we have developed using such software, which could include proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to
enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license, or cease offering our platform unless and until we
can <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-engineer</FONT> such source code in a manner that avoids infringement. This <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-engineering</FONT> process could require us to expend significant additional research and
development resources, and we may not be able to complete the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-engineering</FONT> process successfully. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater
risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protection regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. There is little
legal precedent in this area, and any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could harm our business and could help third parties, including our competitors, develop technology

Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations (collectively,
&#147;HIPAA&#148;). We also must comply with HIPAA in regard to certain of our self-insured health benefits for our employees and their dependents. HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI and imposes
privacy, security, and breach notification obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating,
receiving, maintaining, or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities, and their covered subcontractors. We and our affiliated professional entities must comply with HIPAA requirements,

practices, or an audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;) may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to
enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance.</FONT> HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations; however, a single breach incident
can result in violations of multiple standards, which could result in significant fines. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents and enables courts to award damages, costs, and attorneys&#146; fees
related to violations of HIPAA in connection with those suits. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in
state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. Any such penalties or lawsuits could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and reputation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">HIPAA further requires that individuals be notified in certain instances of unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or
disclosure of their unsecured PHI. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured PHI to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, not to exceed 60 days following discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification
also must be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Business associates must report breaches of unsecured PHI to covered entities within 60 days of discovery of the breach by the
business associate or its agents or such shorter period as may be provided for in contractual agreements. A <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-permitted</FONT> use or disclosure of PHI is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the covered
entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with requirements enumerated in HIPAA. Any obligations to send such notifications could severely damage our reputation and
affect the confidence of our customers, channel partners, and members. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Certain states have also adopted comparable
privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance
issues for us, our affiliated professional entities, and our future customers, channel partners, and strategic partners. For example, the CCPA requires covered businesses that process the personal information of California residents to, among other
things: (i)&nbsp;provide certain disclosures to California residents regarding the business&#146;s collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information; (ii)&nbsp;receive and respond to requests from California residents to access, delete,
and correct their personal information, or to opt out of certain disclosures of their personal information; and (iii)&nbsp;enter into specific contractual provisions with service providers that process California resident personal information on the
business&#146;s behalf. Additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have been passed in other states and are continuing to be proposed at the state and federal level, including a new
comprehensive federal data protection law to which we would become subject to, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S. The enactment of such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make
compliance challenging. </P>

requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of medical devices. However, historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion for certain <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-risk</FONT> software functions and has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the regulation of software as a medical device. In addition, the 21st Century Cures Act amended the FDCA to exclude
from the definition of &#147;medical device&#148; certain medical-related software, including software used for administrative support functions at a healthcare facility, software intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle, software
designed to store electronic health records, software for transferring, storing, or displaying medical device data or in vitro diagnostic data, and certain clinical decision support software. We believe our current software applications for our Care
Teams generally provide clinical decision support functionality that is exempt from the FDCA&#146;s definition of a &#147;medical device.&#148; Our current software applications and AI technologies only deliver recommendations directly to members in
a manner intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle, and we believe that this functionality is also exempt from the FDCA&#146;s definition of a &#147;medical device.&#148; Therefore, we believe that our software applications are not
currently regulated by the FDA as medical devices or otherwise subject to FDA&#146;s current enforcement discretion policies applicable to software. However, there is a risk that the FDA could disagree with our determination if, for example, it is
perceived that we are providing, or if we unintentionally provide, automated diagnoses or automated delivery of healthcare to our members. Additionally, the FDA could alter its enforcement discretion policies or our strategy for the use of AI and
software could change. Any of the above may subject our software applications to more stringent medical device regulations. </P>

therapists. These laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion, and are subject to change and to evolving interpretations by state boards of physical
therapy and state attorneys general, among others. We enter into agreements with a professional corporation, PPTG, which enters into contracts with licensed physical therapists pursuant to which they render professional services. Our agreements
include management services agreements with PPTG pursuant to which the professional entity reserves exclusive control and responsibility for all aspects of the practice of physical therapy and the delivery of medical services. In addition, we enter
into contracts with our customers and channel partners on behalf of PPTG to deliver professional services in exchange for fees. Changes in, or subsequent interpretations of, the corporate practice of physical therapy or <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">fee-splitting</FONT> prohibitions could circumscribe our business operations, and state officials who administer these laws or other third parties may successfully challenge our existing organization and contractual
arrangements. If such a claim were successful, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and could be required to restructure or terminate the applicable contractual arrangements. A determination that these arrangements violate state
statutes, or our inability to successfully restructure our relationships with PPTG to comply with these statutes, could eliminate customers and channel partners located in certain states from the market for our programs, which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. State corporate practice of physical therapy doctrines also often impose penalties on physical therapists themselves for aiding the corporate practice of
physical therapy, which could discourage physical therapists from providing services needed for our programs. We do not own PPTG which is wholly owned by licensed physical therapists. While we expect that this relationship will continue, we cannot
guarantee that it will. A material change in our relationship with PPTG, whether resulting from a dispute among the entities, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these affiliations, could impair our ability to provide services to our
members and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, the arrangement in which we have entered to comply with state corporate practice of physical therapy doctrines
could subject us to additional scrutiny by federal and state regulatory bodies regarding federal and state fraud, waste, and abuse laws. Any scrutiny, investigation, or litigation with regard to our arrangement with PPTG could have a material

are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. Federal and state governments in the U.S. and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare,
improve quality of care, and expand access to healthcare. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act (the &#147;ACA&#148;), made major changes in how healthcare is
delivered and reimbursed and increased access to health insurance by the uninsured and underinsured population of the U.S. The ACA, among other things, increased the number of individuals eligible for Medicaid and private insurance coverage,
implemented reimbursement policies that tie payment to quality, facilitated the creation of accountable care organizations that may use capitation and other alternative payment methodologies, strengthened enforcement of fraud, waste, and abuse laws,
and encouraged the use of IT. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In addition, the ACA requires (with limited exceptions) that private health plans cover
certain recommended preventive services without imposing member cost-sharing. For these purposes, &#147;preventive services&#148; refer to services selected by certain agencies, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Qualified health
plans for individuals and the small-group market must also cover certain &#147;essential benefits,&#148; including chronic disease management, although those plans may meet that ACA requirement with other services and are not required to cover
Omada&#146;s programs specifically. Any changes to these coverage requirements and/or cost-sharing prohibitions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. </P>

not affect HSA eligibility for a high-deductible plan participant. Nevertheless, any future changes to this guidance or to the types of care that high-deductible health plan participants may receive without cost-sharing may require us to collect
cost-sharing for those individuals, cause fewer customers and channel partners to make our programs available, cause fewer covered individuals to choose to enroll in our programs, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial

These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May&nbsp;1, 2020
through March&nbsp;31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers,
including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in
Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially and adversely affect demand for our programs among customers, channel partners, and members and affordability for our programs and, accordingly, our business, financial condition, results
of operations, and prospects. Federal, state, or local budget cuts and cancellation of grants to state and local health departments and other agencies have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the number of individuals covered by those government
funds for our programs. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which
first affected physician payment in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall healthcare reimbursement. Such changes in the regulatory environment may also result in changes to
our payer mix that may affect our operations and revenue. Further, the ACA may adversely affect payers by increasing medical costs generally, which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenue as payers seek
to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas. Certain of these provisions are still being implemented, and the full impact of these changes on us cannot be determined at this time. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare
reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payers will pay for healthcare products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our

to provide physical therapy via telehealth to patients in Illinois. The amendment requires, among other things, that initial physical therapy evaluations without a referral or established diagnosis be performed in person and cannot be performed via
telehealth unless necessary to address a documented hardship, including geographical, physical, or weather-related conditions. Further, the amendment states that the use of telehealth as a primary means of delivering physical therapy must be an
exception supported by documentation. The amendment also requires that a physical therapist providing virtual care must have the capacity to provide <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-person</FONT> care within Illinois. Since the passage of this

significant changes to the taxation of income derived from international operations, and it may enact further limitations on the deductibility of business interest. For example, on August&nbsp;16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the

you will experience immediate dilution of $16.17 per share, representing the difference between our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering and the initial public offering price. In addition,
purchasers of common stock in this offering will have contributed 24.3% of the aggregate price paid by all purchasers of our common stock but will own only approximately 14.2% of our total equity outstanding after this offering. Furthermore, if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, or outstanding options and warrants are exercised, you could experience further dilution. For a further description of the dilution that you will experience immediately after this

state courts of the State of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the
Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that, the exclusive forum

the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws will also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against us or any of our directors, officers, employees,
or agents and arising under the Securities Act. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state or federal court,
subject to applicable law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the
application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums, and
protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder&#146;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors,
officers, other employees, or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims (including by making it more costly for stockholders to bring such claims), although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our
compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies&#146; certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings,
and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring
a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions, and there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that
will be contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Economic downturns, market volatility, inflation, tariffs, and uncertainty make it potentially very difficult for us and our
customers and channel partners to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. During challenging economic times, our customers or channel partners may have difficulty gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on
reasonable terms, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us and adversely affect our revenue. Bank failures have had and in the future may have a similar impact on the ability or willingness of our customers and channel partners
to make payments to us and the timing of collection of our receivables. If that were to occur, our financial results could be harmed. Furthermore, we have customers in a variety of different industries. A significant downturn in the economic
activity attributable to any particular industry may cause organizations to react by reducing their capital and operating expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on healthcare matters, including chronic care programs. In
addition, our customers or channel partners may delay or cancel healthcare projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating contracts. To the extent purchases of our programs are perceived by existing or potential customers and channel
partners to be discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general healthcare spending. Also, competitors may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our
business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Further, challenging economic conditions, including as a result of increased inflation and tariffs, may impair
the ability of our customers and channel partners to pay for the services they already have purchased from us, and as a result, our write-offs of accounts receivable could increase. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic
slowdown or recovery. If the condition of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsens, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. </P>

$154.1&nbsp;million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase up to 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock), based on an assumed initial public offering price of $19.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated price

net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under the MidCap Credit Agreement and/or to acquire complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies. We periodically evaluate strategic opportunities; however, we have no current

term SOFR rate, plus 0.10% (&#147;Adjusted SOFR&#148;), plus 7.00%, subject to a floor of 2.50%. Interest on the MidCap Revolving Facility is charged at the sum of Adjusted SOFR plus 4.00%, subject to a floor of 2.50%. As of March&nbsp;31, 2025, the
outstanding balance on the MidCap Term Facility was $30.0&nbsp;million, and the outstanding balance on the MidCap Revolving Facility was $1.0&nbsp;million. See the section titled &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

costs of our programs for a population of covered lives. We also work closely with health plans and PBMs that either cover our programs for a portion of their members as our customers or act as channel partners reselling our programs to their own
end customers. Our channel partners&#146; end customers typically consist of employers that cover our programs for their employees and their dependents. In general, our customers cover the cost of our programs for our members, except that members in
our physical therapy program may incur copays, coinsurance, or deductibles, depending on plan design, much like in-person physical therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We launched our initial program in diabetes prevention and weight health in 2012, with the goal of showing that a virtual
program could achieve the same clinical results as its <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-person</FONT> archetype. Through feedback from our customers, channel partners, members, and the market at large, we then recognized the need to create an
integrated, multi-condition care platform to address multiple, commonly comorbid, chronic conditions. Today, we offer cardiometabolic programs for prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension; a physical therapy program to address musculoskeletal
(&#147;MSK&#148;) conditions; additional support for members taking glucagon-like <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">peptide-1</FONT> agonists <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(&#147;GLP-1&#148;)</FONT> in our cardiometabolic programs (&#147;GLP-1
Care Tracks&#148;); and behavioral health support across all programs. As we have expanded, we have kept our integrated human and technology approach at the center of our business model and have continued to base our program design on clinically
validated evidence. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Since our founding, our programs have had a meaningful, positive impact. As of March 31, 2025, we had
more than 2,000 customers and over 679,000 total members enrolled in one or more programs, and we had supported over one million members since launch. We count a member as enrolled in a program to the extent their participation was billed at least
once in the preceding 12 months. We believe our programs serve a clear need for our customers and channel partners as well as our members, which is reinforced by our strong customer satisfaction and member engagement rates. In 2024, our average
customer satisfaction rate for the year was over 90% for each of program implementation and customer success. Our customer satisfaction rate is based on responses received from program implementation and customer success surveys, which we send to
the contacts at all customers that launched a new program during the measured period and received customer experience services from us. Results are calculated by a third-party customer experience </P>

our experience and input from this vendor, we believe that our customer satisfaction rates are strong and reflect the value of our services to customers. In 2024, more than 55% of members still engaged with our cardiometabolic programs at least once
per month after a year in the program, and over 50% still engaged monthly after two years. We consider members to be still engaged after one year or two years in the program if, during their twelfth or twenty-fourth month of program participation in
a cardiometabolic program, they complete at least one interaction with us, such as logging in or interacting with the Omada mobile app, sending messages to Omada Care Team members, or recording metrics such as weight, blood pressure, or blood
glucose values. On average, in 2024, members in a cardiometabolic program engaged more than 30 times per month throughout their first year. Based on our experience and feedback from customers, we believe these engagement rates to be positive and to
demonstrate the attractiveness of our program to members. We are proud of our progress, and we are just getting started. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We have experienced strong growth since our inception. Revenue increased by 38% from $122.8&nbsp;million to
$169.8&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and by 57% from $35.1 million to $55.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. We incurred net losses of $67.5 million and
$47.1&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $19.0&nbsp;million and $9.4&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We sell our programs to customers that cover the cost for covered individuals. Our customers include employers that cover our
programs for their employees and their dependents, health systems that cover our programs for patients, and any other entity that is financially responsible for costs of our programs for a population of covered lives. We also work closely with
health plans and PBMs that either cover our programs for a portion of their members as our customers or act as channel partners reselling our programs to their own end customers. Our channel partners&#146; end customers typically consist of
employers that cover our programs for their employees and their dependents. In general, our customers cover the cost of our programs for our members, except that members in our physical therapy program may incur copays, coinsurance, or deductibles,
depending on plan design, much like in-person physical therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We generate revenue from sales to our customers and
channel partners for the services that we provide to members. We generate services revenue by providing access to our programs for prevention&nbsp;&amp; weight health, diabetes, hypertension, and MSK conditions and hardware revenue from connected
third-party devices, which are provided to the member upon enrollment in our cardiometabolic programs. Upfront payments or billings received from customers and channel partners are initially recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and
recognized as revenue as we fulfill our obligations. We believe our revenue is highly recurring in nature, with a three-year average customer retention rate of over 90% as of December&nbsp;31, 2024. We continue to generate revenue from recurring
customers, as evidenced by our net dollar retention rate, which for customers who were contracted as of the beginning of the prior period, is calculated as total billings generated in a particular period divided by total billings generated in the
prior period and was 110% and 128% for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. </P>

more than 2,000 customers and over 679,000 total members enrolled in one or more programs that were billable in the preceding 12 months. We sell primarily to employers, who either contract with Omada directly or obtain access to our programs through
a channel partner, such as a health plan or PBM, and a key part of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">go-to-market</FONT></FONT> strategy is winning new employer contracts during the annual benefits selling season.
During that time, our sales and marketing team engages with human resources professionals, benefits managers, and decision makers across various industries to sign up new customers. We sell our programs directly to customers and through channel
partners. This selling season typically spans from late spring to early fall, aligning implementation with benefits enrollment schedules and allowing us to launch our products for customers at the start of the following year. </P>

specific therapeutic programs, or via health systems that assume the cost of care for their patients. We leverage our partner sales team, which engages with health plans and PBMs, to identify new, and expand existing, partner channels through which

program. Outreach campaigns can be led by the customer or channel partner or led by Omada, leveraging our preferred methods and materials. The cost of our enrollment and outreach teams are recognized primarily within sales and marketing expense.

and we provide the member with a set of connected third-party devices. Each Care Team consists of a primary health coach or specialist, additional relevant specialists where applicable, and/or a licensed physical therapist, depending on the program.
Member Support Agents also provide device and platform support to members across all programs, via phone, email, and self-service support articles. The connected third-party devices supplied in connection with our programs can include scales, blood
pressure monitors, blood glucose monitors, and continuous glucose monitors. The cost of our Care Team and our connected third-party devices are all recognized within cost of revenue. </P>

to build the infrastructure that supports our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">go-to-market</FONT></FONT> approach. The strength of our relationships with customers is evidenced in our three-year average customer
retention rate of over 90%, and our customer satisfaction rate of over 90% for each of program implementation and customer success, each as of December&nbsp;31, 2024, and our customer net promoter score, which we measure biannually, of 70 as of

growth. We have seen significant expansion over time as existing customers and channel partners have added our newer Diabetes and Hypertension programs, and we remain focused on driving multi-program adoption as a key growth lever. We believe there
is still opportunity to continue multi-condition expansion. As of December&nbsp;31, 2024, approximately 31% of our customers covered more than one Omada program, which leaves sizable opportunities to sell additional programs.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We generate services revenue from our customers by providing access to our virtual care programs in which our Care Teams
implement clinically validated behavior change protocols for individuals living with prediabetes and weight management issues, diabetes, and hypertension (collectively referred to as &#147;cardiometabolic&#148; conditions) and MSK conditions over
the term of the program. Our MSK program generally includes a fixed, upfront consultation fee and an additional fee for members that opt in to a physical therapist-guided treatment plan. We use a number of pricing models for our cardiometabolic
programs. In general, our legacy pricing models for cardiometabolic programs may include a fixed, upfront enrollment fee and include variable monthly fees which are based on either outcomes or milestones for the respective member service period. In
general, our latest pricing models for cardiometabolic programs are based on the respective member&#146;s level of activity in the program. Each month, members that have completed a minimum number of qualifying activities during an agreed-upon
backward-looking measurement period are considered billable members. The length of the measurement period and the qualifying activities may vary based on negotiations with customers and channel partners. Most activity measurement periods are defined
as the preceding three or six months, and in most cases, members are considered active if they complete three activities during that period, such as logging in or interacting with the Omada mobile app, sending messages to Omada Care Team members, or
recording metrics such as weight, blood pressure, or blood glucose values. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The price for Omada for Diabetes and Omada for
Hypertension is generally higher than the price for Omada for Prevention&nbsp;&amp; Weight Health to account for the higher costs of delivering those programs, including additional included devices and increased Care Team support appropriate for
those conditions. We typically bill for our services monthly, in arrears. We recognize a portion of revenue upfront upon hardware delivery or initial consultation and the remaining revenue over the period members have access to our virtual care
programs. In general, among our members in cardiometabolic programs, members in Omada for Diabetes and Omada for Hypertension remain active and enrolled in our programs for longer periods than members in Omada for Prevention&nbsp;&amp; Weight
Health. In addition to the overall number of members, our quarterly revenues reflect the mix of members enrolled in our various programs and the pricing models for these programs. </P>

in the second and third quarters, aligning with benefits enrollment schedules and allowing us to launch our products at the start of the following year. This seasonality generally leads to higher new member enrollment in the first and second
quarters, resulting in increased Care Team costs to support the newly enrolled members. These higher new member enrollments also require shipments of new devices to newly enrolled members in the same quarter of enrollment or the beginning of the
following quarter and increased hardware revenue in those periods. These increased costs result in lower overall gross margins in those quarters and there is typically a decrease in these costs in subsequent quarters. After the effects of these
early program costs of new enrollments, increases in the number of members will generally be reflected in increased revenue in subsequent quarters as services revenue is generally recognized in arrears after the provision of our virtual care
programs begins. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Obesity and Weight Management </I></B></P>

2024, a 73% increase compared to 2023, according to public filings by the respective drug manufacturers. GLP-1 therapies can represent a significant cost burden to employers and other entities
(including health plans and PBMs). For example, employers pay for GLP-1 therapies with list prices that can exceed $1,000 per month. However, the lasting value derived from the prescription alone may be limited without long-term behavior change. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2024, FDA-approved labels guided that GLP-1 therapies prescribed in adults for obesity or chronic weight management should be prescribed concurrently with a behavioral and lifestyle treatment plan. Accordingly, we believe that
the growth in GLP-1 medication prescriptions may also result in increased interest in lifestyle modification programs such as our cardiometabolic programs, which can support members on a GLP-1 therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The GLP-1 treatment landscape is relatively new and evolving, and actions by employers, health plans, PBMs, pharmaceutical
companies, regulators, and other third parties could impact the adoption of our GLP-1 Care Tracks. While our GLP-1 Care Tracks are designed to be offered only to eligible members who are also engaged in one of our cardiometabolic programs, demand
for those cardiometabolic programs could fluctuate and impact our financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Quarterly Results of Operations and Other Data </B></P>

March&nbsp;31, 2025. The unaudited quarterly statements of operations data set forth below have been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and, in the
opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that are necessary for the fair statement of such data. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the
future, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other period. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and, in each case, the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

members. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">A significant proportion of our sales largely follows benefit enrollment schedules. We close new deals and
expansions of existing deals with customers and channel partners throughout the year, often as they prepare benefit packages for the following year, and many of our existing customers and channel partners evaluate benefits renewals on a
calendar-year basis. This cycle generally leads to the largest number of new member enrollments in the first quarter, which aligns with many open enrollment periods, when many customers and channel partners launch new offerings and conduct the
largest member outreach campaigns. We deliver connected devices near each member&#146;s start date in our programs, and we recognize revenue from those connected devices together with our services revenue during the early months following a
member&#146;s enrollment. Thereafter, we recognize additional revenue as we continue to provide ongoing care services, but we generally do not provide additional devices unless members enroll in a new program. This has generally resulted in higher
hardware revenue in the first quarter, followed by a decrease in hardware revenue as the ongoing services become the primary revenue source. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Our cost of revenue per member has typically been highest in the first quarter because we generally enroll the largest number
of new members during that time, which results in shipments of new devices and increased Care Team costs to support newly enrolled members during the early months of their respective enrollment. The bundled cost of our care services and the
connected devices initially exceeds their separate, standalone prices, resulting in lower initial margins. After the early months following their enrollment, our members generally require less support, which lowers Care Team costs for those members,
and we generally do not provide additional devices unless a member enrolls in a new program. As a result, our gross margin historically has improved in the months following seasonal periods of high new member enrollments, typically beginning in the
second quarter and continuing for the rest of the fiscal year. Historically, our gross margin in a given period has also generally increased compared to the same period of the prior year due to decreased personnel costs per total members and
year-over-year improvements in strategic efficiency initiatives such as improving the effectiveness of our Care Team interventions and Care Team time management, as well as expanded use of supporting technologies such as tools for Care Team message
support described above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Operating Expenses </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Operating expenses have generally risen over time, primarily due to increased personnel costs to support business growth.
However, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue have generally decreased over time primarily due to declining personnel costs as a percentage of revenue, arising from economies of scale and strategic resource deployment, partially offset by
administrative and marketing fees that we pay to channel partners for their services in support of our member enrollments, which have largely remained consistent as a percentage of revenue. General and administrative costs increased for the three
months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2024 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2023, mainly due to higher non-capitalizable professional and outside service
expenses related to financial statement audits and preparing for public company operations, as well as personnel costs related to preparing for public company operations, and share-based compensation expenses, including those associated with
secondary sales of common stock by certain current and former employees. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements and Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for
additional detail on the secondary transactions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Quarterly Trends in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-GAAP</FONT> Financial

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from issuance of our redeemable convertible
preferred stock, debt financing agreements, and cash generated from the sale of our products and services. As of March&nbsp;31, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $59.4&nbsp;million and working capital of
$53.3&nbsp;million. Cash and cash equivalents are composed of cash held in sweep accounts, checking accounts, and money market funds. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations and invest in R&amp;D to support our growth. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We have generated significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities in the past, as
reflected in our accumulated deficit of $453.4&nbsp;million as of March&nbsp;31, 2025. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements,
however, will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and R&amp;D expenditures, the continuing market acceptance of our products and services, and the use of cash to fund potential mergers
or acquisitions. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and on
acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In May 2020, we entered into the Perceptive Credit Agreement for a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an

March&nbsp;31, 2022 (the &#147;Perceptive Loan&#148;). Upon the closing date, we drew down $30.0&nbsp;million of the Perceptive Loan. The maturity date of the Perceptive Loan was May&nbsp;18, 2025. The outstanding principal balance and accrued
interest were paid in full in June 2023 with a portion of the proceeds of the MidCap Term Facility (as defined below), and as of December&nbsp;31, 2023, the outstanding balance was $0. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In June 2023, we entered into a financing arrangement with Physera, Inc., MidCap Funding IV Trust (&#147;MidCap&#148;), as

availability of the Second Tranche until December&nbsp;31, 2025 and (ii) modified the Revenue Condition to require trailing 12-month revenue of $165.0&nbsp;million if the Second Tranche is advanced during the first fiscal quarter of 2025,
$170.0&nbsp;million if the Second Tranche is advanced during the second fiscal quarter of 2025, $175.0&nbsp;million if the Second Tranche is advanced during the third fiscal quarter of 2025, and $180.0&nbsp;million if the Second Tranche is advanced
during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025. Upon the initial closing date of the MidCap Credit Agreement, we drew down on $30.0&nbsp;million of the MidCap Term Facility and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balance
(including prepayment premium) and accrued interest on the Perceptive Credit Agreement. The MidCap Term Facility is interest-only for 48 months. At the end of the initial interest-only period, we can elect to extend the interest-only period an
additional 12 months if we meet a certain trailing 12-month revenue level (the &#147;Minimum Net Revenue&#148;) and no event of default has occurred and is continuing. The MidCap Credit Agreement also includes a revolving line of credit facility
(the &#147;MidCap Revolving Facility&#148;) allowing for up to $20.0&nbsp;million in revolving borrowings. The availability of the MidCap Revolving Facility is calculated as a percentage of our outstanding accounts receivable and inventory balances
(&#147;Availability&#148;). We are required to maintain a minimum drawn balance on the MidCap Revolving Facility of no less than 20% of Availability, or will be required to pay a fee equal to the MidCap Revolving Facility interest rate on the
difference between the amount of revolving loans drawn and 20% of Availability. Upon the initial closing date of the MidCap Credit Agreement, we drew $1.0&nbsp;million on the MidCap Revolving Facility. The maturity date of the MidCap Term Facility
and the MidCap Revolving Facility is June&nbsp;1, 2028. As of each of December&nbsp;31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, the outstanding balance on the MidCap Term Facility was $30.0&nbsp;million and the outstanding balance on the MidCap Revolving Facility
was $1.0&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Interest is charged on any outstanding principal of the MidCap Term Facility at the sum of the
one-month forward-looking term SOFR rate, plus 0.10% (&#147;Adjusted SOFR&#148;), plus 7.00%, subject to a floor of 2.50%. Interest on the MidCap Revolving Facility is charged at the sum of Adjusted SOFR plus 4.00%, subject to a floor of 2.50%. Both
interest rates are reset monthly. The effective interest rate for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2024 and 2025 was 14.4% and 13.4%, respectively, on the MidCap Term Facility, and 12.0% and 11.3%, respectively, on the MidCap Revolving

advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: (i)&nbsp;being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements, in addition
to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; disclosure in this prospectus; (ii)&nbsp;reduced disclosure
about our executive compensation arrangements; (iii)&nbsp;not being required to hold advisory votes on executive compensation or to obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements not previously approved; (iv)&nbsp;an exemption from
the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and (v)&nbsp;an exemption from compliance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor&#146;s report on the financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth
company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235&nbsp;billion or more; (ii)&nbsp;the last day of our fiscal
year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of this offering; (iii)&nbsp;the date on which we have issued more than $1.0&nbsp;billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv)&nbsp;the date on which we
are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this prospectus. Accordingly, the
information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. Additionally, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition
period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail
ourselves of this exemption, and therefore, while we are an emerging growth company, we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth
companies. As a result of this election, our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to those of other public companies that comply with new or revised accounting
pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, and $31.0&nbsp;million outstanding as of March&nbsp;31, 2025. Our financing arrangements subject us to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance outstanding and could be adversely impacted by rising
interest rates in the future. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, or on our unaudited

impact of inflation and tariffs, are impacting customer and channel partner spending decisions. Given the current macroeconomic environment, we continue to look for ways to manage costs and mitigate any changes in the purchasing behavior of our
customers and channel partners that may occur due to significant inflationary pressure, tariffs, or other factors. If our costs, in particular labor, sales and marketing, and cloud hosting costs, become subject to sustained or increased inflationary
or other macroeconomic pressure, we may be unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. </P>

statements. Accounting policies that have a significant impact on our results are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical. We consider an accounting policy to be critical if the policy is subject to a material level of judgment and if changes in those judgments are
reasonably likely to materially impact our results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We base our estimates and judgments on reasonably available

Channel partners include PBMs and health plans that have commercial relationships with our customers. Pursuant to our agreements with channel partners, some channel partners receive an administrative or marketing fee for their services, and we
engage directly with our customers with respect to the provision of our services. Our customer acquisition teams work directly with customers on onboarding and enrollment processes for new members. While health plans are customers for their fully

milestone-based fees, as applicable, for the respective member service period and may include an upfront member enrollment fee. Variable consideration related to the activity-, outcome-, or milestone-based fees is estimated at contract inception for
the non-cancelable term (ranging from 30 to 180 days) to the extent a significant reversal in revenue will not occur. We use the expected value method, primarily relying on our history, to estimate variable consideration, including service-level
agreements and performance guarantees based on clinical outcomes. Changes to estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented given the relatively short non-cancelable term. Reassessments of variable consideration may
occur as historical information changes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The estimated transaction price allocated to services is recognized over time

market approach also included reference to our own stock transactions when issuances of redeemable convertible preferred stock were made close to the valuation date. The income approach involves
applying an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to projected cash flows based on forecasted revenue and costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Once
the enterprise value was determined under the market approach or income approach, we derived the equity value of our company using either an option pricing model (&#147;OPM&#148;) or a hybrid method of OPM and the probability weighted expected
return method (&#147;PWERM&#148;) to allocate that value among the various classes of securities to arrive at the fair value of the common stock. The OPM is based on the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which allows for the identification
for a range of possible future outcomes, each with an associated probability. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is difficult to predict and thus creates highly speculative forecasts. PWERM involves a
forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes of the enterprise including an IPO as well as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-IPO</FONT> market-based outcomes. After the equity value is determined and allocated to the various classes
of shares, a discount for lack of marketability (&#147;DLOM&#148;) is applied to arrive at the fair value of ordinary shares. A DLOM is applied based on the theory that, as an owner of a private company stock, the stockholder has limited
opportunities to sell this stock, and any such sale would involve significant transaction costs, thereby reducing overall fair market value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In addition, we also considered any secondary transactions involving our capital stock. In our evaluation of those
transactions, we considered the facts and circumstances of each transaction to determine the extent to which they represented a fair value exchange. Factors considered include transaction volume, timing, whether the transactions occurred among
unrelated parties, and whether the transactions involved investors with access to our financial information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Application
of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the
selection of comparable companies, and the probability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a

warrant&#146;s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, <I>Distinguishing Liabilities from</I> <I>Equity</I>, and ASC 815, <I>Derivatives and Hedging</I>. We have issued redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants and
common stock warrants which are classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets because the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants are freestanding financial instruments that may require us to transfer assets upon exercise, and
the common stock warrants contain a term that may require adjustment to the exercise price. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which incorporates assumptions and estimates, to value the redeemable convertible preferred stock
warrants and common stock warrants. Stock volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is determined by
reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The dividend yield is estimated at 0% based on the expected dividend yield as we do not anticipate paying any cash
dividends in the foreseeable future. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially
impact future fair values of outstanding warrants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In connection with the closing of this offering, the warrants to

program to the extent their participation was billed at least once in the preceding 12 months. We believe our programs serve a clear need for our customers and channel partners as well as our members, which is reinforced by our strong customer
satisfaction and member engagement rates. In 2024, our average customer satisfaction rate for the year was over 90% for each of program implementation and customer success. Our customer satisfaction rate is based on responses received from program
implementation and customer success surveys, which we send to the contacts at all customers that launched a new program during the measured period and received customer experience services from us. Results are calculated by a third-party customer
experience management vendor, and we consider a customer to be satisfied if they rated our program implementation and ongoing customer success, as applicable, at a 5 or higher on a 7-point scale. Based on our experience and input from this vendor,
we believe that our customer satisfaction rates are strong and reflect the value of our services to customers. In 2024, more than 55% of members still engaged with our cardiometabolic programs at least once per month after a year in the program, and
over 50% still engaged monthly after two years. We consider members to be still engaged after one year or two years in the program if, during their twelfth or twenty-fourth month of program participation in a cardiometabolic program, they complete
at least one interaction with us, such as logging in or interacting with the Omada mobile app, sending messages to Omada Care Team members, or recording metrics such as weight, blood pressure, or blood glucose values. On average, in 2024, members in
a cardiometabolic program engaged more than 30 times per month throughout their first year. Based on our experience and feedback from customers, we believe these engagement rates to be positive and to demonstrate the attractiveness of our program to
members. We are proud of our progress, and we are just getting started. </P>

weight management. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) has approved multiple new drug applications from third parties for the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (&#147;GLP-1s&#148;) to treat diabetes and obesity alongside
changes in diet and exercise informed by the safety and efficacy results derived from human clinical trials. Many consider these medications a generational breakthrough in the fight against obesity and obesity-related chronic conditions such as
diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, among other conditions. Even with this breakthrough, we believe the critical need to encourage lasting behavior change remains. For those who can and choose to use
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1s,</FONT> behavior change can help increase weight loss and counter the likely weight regain after discontinuation. For those who cannot or choose not to use <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1s,</FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1s</FONT> have driven dramatic growth in the obesity market, with combined global sales
of Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy, and Mounjaro reaching approximately $41.4&nbsp;billion in 2024, a 73% increase compared to 2023, according to public filings by the respective drug manufacturers. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1s</FONT> represent
a significant cost burden, however, and can cost over $1,000 per patient per month. Meanwhile, the lasting value derived from this therapy may be limited after discontinuation. An early randomized controlled trial published in <I>Diabetes,
Obesity</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;&amp; Metabolism</I> in 2022 showed patients regained <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-thirds</FONT> of their prior weight loss at one year after withdrawing from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> use. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">These therapies present both an opportunity and a challenge: employers and other entities that pay for <FONT

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1s.</FONT> According to a 2024 survey of 279 employers conducted by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, while the majority of employers covered GLP-1 therapies for diabetes, only 34% of
employers covered the drugs for diabetes and weight loss, and 19% of the 158 employers who covered the drugs for diabetes only were considering adding weight loss coverage. Some employers, such as Hennepin Health, Ascension, and University of Texas,

programs, such as Medicare Advantage, or through PBMs and health systems, where those individuals are not also covered by the commercial health insurance described above. According to a 2024 report from KFF, this target population covered by
commercial health insurance is composed of approximately 154&nbsp;million individuals. Of this target population, we estimate that, as of December 31, 2024, approximately 18&nbsp;million individuals had access to one or more Omada programs through
these commercial health insurance providers and the remainder either had health insurance coverage through commercial health insurance providers that did not cover Omada programs at all or as part of populations that our current customers did not

condition for the U.S. population as a whole and therefore assume that these conditions do not vary by geography. Because our members are geographically diverse and all reside in the U.S., we believe national data is representative of the target
population. If in the future our members are no longer limited to the U.S. or cease to be geographically diverse within the U.S., our calculations would be correspondingly affected. Our estimates for prediabetes, hypertension, and MSK conditions are
based on available data that is not age-group specific, although the data used for prediabetes and hypertension is limited to adults. Accordingly, our estimates do not account for how prevalence rates for prediabetes, hypertension, and MSK
conditions may vary across age groups. Because our estimates for diabetes are based on available data from the CDC that is age-group specific, the estimates for diabetes utilized different prevalence rates across age groups based on that
information. If estimates for the prevalence of U.S. individuals with prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, or MSK conditions change, including, where used in our estimates, by age group, our calculations would be affected correspondingly. </P>

2.549 Omada members through their participation in our program. The analysis included all members covered by Evernorth Health Services SafeGuardRx program that were enrolled in Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health between March 2022 and July
2023 and had at least one paid insurance claim for GLP-1 use between October 2022 and May 2023 in data made available to us by our PBM partner, Express Scripts by Evernorth. The date range of members included was based on the range of claims payment
data made available to us. The claims payment data made available to us was limited to Omada members who were covered by the SafeguardRx program. We do not have comparable data regarding paid GLP-1 claims for other members not covered by the
SafeguardRx program. The analysis included a large sample size, and because the analysis was retrospective, members included in the analysis were not required to take any special actions that other members in our program were not. Therefore, we
believe that the group of members included in the analysis is a representative group of members who take GLP-1 therapy and enroll and engage in Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health. To study the effect of our program, the analysis compared the
results for members with more meaningful engagement with our program with the results for members with less meaningful engagement. For this purpose, members were divided into groups reflecting "meaningful" engagement with our program (defined as
equal to or greater than the median amount of observed engagement) and "limited" engagement with our program (defined as less than the median amount of observed engagement) using a median split of their total interactions with the Omada program each
month. All Prevention &amp; Weight Health members covered by the SafeguardRx program were pooled together during the observed time period, regardless of evidence of paid GLP-1 claims, to calculate the median level of engagement. We did not calculate
median engagement using only members with paid insurance claims for GLP-1s because we believe that median engagement across all members in the analysis establishes a representative benchmark for meaningful use of our program in general. Results of
future members may vary from those observed in this retrospective analysis. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="font-size:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

positive experiences and outcomes for members. Facilitating this at scale is complex and requires integrated software that supports the member experience as well as Care Team and device operations. The most commonly used electronic health record
(&#147;EHR&#148;) systems on the market do not offer all of the features we believe are necessary for Between-Visit Care. Existing EHR systems built for traditional care did not support the level of communication, content integration, continuous
workflow optimization, or ease of use we desired. So we built our own. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Our Care Team Platform is designed for easy and
efficient navigation, and to enable our Care Teams to drive positive outcomes for members. Upon enrollment, we match members with other members in peer groups based on similar geographic location and life stage, then assign a Care Team depending on
the program and context. Through the Care Team Platform, we surface shared member context for easy reference and enable Care Team members to communicate with each other and with members through asynchronous messaging. Our proprietary tools also
enhance many activities in the Care Team workflow. For example, we have developed algorithms, informed by data from our member interactions, that can help prioritize and organize our Care Teams&#146; inboxes. These algorithms can also identify
potential high-impact opportunities to support a member and can surface those opportunities for review and action by our trained Care Teams.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We regularly assess operating workflows and care path activities with a goal of making our Care Teams more effective and
efficient. For example, in 2023, we reduced the time needed for a coach to support the first year of a member&#146;s journey with Omada for Prevention&nbsp;&amp; Weight Health by 5% without negatively impacting our key measures of member engagement.
To accomplish this, we highlighted patterns in members&#146; early engagement profiles and incorporated new criteria to help our Care Teams identify priority members for outreach. We enabled our Care Teams to make more targeted clinical
interventions that considered how likely a member was to respond and added detail to make the topics more relevant to a given member&#146;s journey from the very first month. Going forward, we expect to continue evaluating potential workflow
efficiencies to further scale the impact of our Care Teams. </P>

can result in several ongoing program implementations, confusion among employees, under-utilization of the different programs, and difficulty measuring outcomes across an employee population. Omada offers a single platform that delivers integrated,
evidence-based chronic condition programs for several condition areas without the need to contract with multiple providers, providing a streamlined and convenient experience for members. </P>

the American Physical Therapy Association recommend using &#147;telerehabilitation&#148; (i.e., virtual physical therapy). These guidelines concluded that, when compared to in-person care for appropriate diagnoses, on balance, the benefits of
virtual physical therapy (which include improved accessibility, increased adherence to treatment plans, and potential improvement in the timeliness of services) outweigh the risks, harms, and costs of virtual physical therapy (which include
potential cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, potential safety risks in certain circumstances if the provider is unable to assist the patient at home, and the potential for poorer patient outcomes and experiences if barriers compromise a
physical therapist&#146;s ability to effectively manage a plan of care virtually). Virtual physical therapy can be comparable to in-person care for patient acceptability, satisfaction, and clinical outcomes and superior for adherence and attendance.

"initiation" phase of GLP-1 treatment (i.e., within the first eight weeks) or the "titration" phase (i.e., taking the lowest or second-lowest dose of a GLP-1 therapy)) and self-reported no diagnosis of diabetes at that time. Where metrics compare
data from Enhanced GLP-1 Care Track members to a comparison group of members not enrolled in the Enhanced GLP-1 Care Track, the comparison group consists of data received directly from members that self-reported the same requirements for GLP-1 use
and no diabetes diagnosis at the time of application and enrolled in Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health and Omada for Hypertension between May and early June 2024. The analysis was retrospective, and members in the analysis were not required
to take any special actions that other members in our programs were not, except for voluntarily opting into the Enhanced GLP-1 Care Track. Self-efficacy was measured by asking members about their confidence level in their ability to lose weight, on
a 5-point scale of "not at all confident" to "completely confident," when differing levels of effort would be required, such as having to try several times, make a detailed plan, or rethink their entire way of losing weight. The questions used for
this assessment were previously developed to measure weight-loss self-efficacy by an independent academic research team and published in a peer-reviewed journal on psychological assessment in 2017. </FONT></P>

weight at the time of GLP-1 discontinuation, members eligible for this discontinuation program support must have self-reported in an intake survey (i) never having received a diagnosis for diabetes, (ii) having taken a GLP-1 therapy for weight loss
for at least eight weeks, and (iii) having disconcontinued the GLP-1 therapy within four weeks of receiving the intake survey. Of the 158 members who opted into receiving the GLP-1 discontinuation program support during the period mentioned above
and met the eligibility criteria above, only those who completed a 12-week follow-up survey, self-reported not restarting GLP-1 therapy at that time, and recorded their follow-up weight 16 weeks after GLP-1 discontinuation were included in this
retrospective analysis, with a final n-size of 63 members. The retrospective analysis reviewed data received directly through these members' participation in the program. Values shown for listed randomized control trials ("RCTs") reflect the

increasing the number of enrolled members across our covered populations. We work with customers and channel partners to develop tailored, multi-channel outreach programs spanning email, traditional mail, company communications, and workplace

practice approach to member enrollment outreach. We can lead outreach campaigns ourselves or support customers and channel partners with materials to lead their own campaigns, providing flexibility for them in engaging their populations. In 2024,
more than half of new member enrollments came from campaigns where Omada led the outreach. Increased adoption of our email outreach program, combined with ongoing email optimizations, has led to significant enrollment rate growth over the last few
years. From 2023 to 2024, our average email enrollment rate, which refers to the percentage of a customer&#146;s population that receives our email enrollment campaigns that enrolls into our programs, increased by more than 60%, and the number of
enrollments attributed to email outreach increased by 75%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We also develop custom strategies for our customers and channel
partners to identify and reach prospective members who are likely to benefit from our programs. Data from customers or channel partners can identify individuals known to have the conditions we serve, and with this data, we can deliver more tailored
outreach messaging. In 2024, customers and channel partners who enabled us to launch email outreach campaigns saw average enrollments equal to 14% of the total eligible population we emailed. However, where we were able to deliver more tailored
outreach for relevant conditions, we saw some higher rates. For example, when customers and channel partners enabled email outreach tailored for the subset of people living with diabetes, they saw an 8% increase in average enrollment rate in the
same period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Our enrollment platform&#146;s testing and learning environment powers our outreach optimization efforts. We
continuously test outreach messaging and strategies, and monitor performance during live campaigns, to understand which content resonates best with which members. Customers and channel partners appreciate our insights on how to engage their
population, and we have consistently achieved improvements in enrollment rates over the last two years. We hope to further improve these efforts through our consistent, iterative campaign testing, increasing the reach and frequency of campaigns
where we lead outreach, and continued exploration of future potential AI and ML capabilities across our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Our
purpose-built enrollment platform supports the entire <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">go-to-market</FONT></FONT> process from closed sale to member enrollment. We efficiently intake population outreach files,
operationalize enrollment outreach strategies, and generate custom reports for customers and channel partners to quantify the success of our efforts. As we have scaled our operations, we have proactively invested in robust data systems, platform
upgrades, and risk mitigation. We also invest in data visibility, quality, and system resiliency to support our goals of seamless outreach and an excellent experience for customers and channel partners. Recent platform upgrades executed in 2023
resulted in significant operational efficiencies in the 2024 enrollment period, including significant decreases in processing time while maintaining our focus on quality control. </P>

to meet their changing needs and preferences. We recognize that, in many ways, healthcare remains disjointed and confusing for the average consumer. According to NFP&#146;s 2023 U.S. Benefits Trend Report, 61% of employees with employer-sponsored
health insurance did not fully understand their benefits. This makes it even more important and challenging to identify prospective members and to deliver effective messaging at the right time to drive enrollment. </P>

dependents as of February 2024. Over a Decade with Omada Costco was an early adopter of Omada, launching our Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health program in 2013, and throughout the years, Costco has consistently emphasized quality care and
member experience. After years of successful service, Costco expanded to adopt our multi-condition platform, adding Omada for Diabetes in 2020, Omada for MSK in 2021, and Omada for Hypertension in 2023. Costco cites our ability to deliver a quality
experience and consistent services for its employees and dependents at scale, together with the advantages of our coordinated, multi-condition platform, as reasons for expansion. Costco has partnered with us to deploy a wide range of member outreach
strategies. With Costco, we have utilized our outreach best practices approach of Omada-led outreach and tailored communications for individuals with known clinical risk. In combination, Costco has led communications such as annual enrollment
challenges and member testimonial videos broadcast nationally. Key Results for Members Covered by Costco as of December 2024 ENROLLMENT Since launch, 27% of estimated eligible individuals receiving email outreach had enrolled in our programs. WEIGHT

other populations. Cigna Ventures, LLC, an affiliate of The Cigna Group, is also a significant stockholder in our company. For a more detailed description of that relationship, see the section titled "Principal Stockholders." Partnership Over Time
and At Scale Our partnership began in 2015, working together on a pilot program that introduced Omada's prediabetes solution, Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health, to a select group of Cigna Healthcare administrative services only (ASO) clients.
In 2018, after the success of this pilot, Cigna Healthcare made Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health an available offering that all self-insured employers could purchase. In 2020, Cigna Healthcare expanded its partnership with us by launching
the Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health program as an embedded benefit for several lines of business, including certain fully insured segments, and by adding Omada for Diabetes and Omada for Hypertension as available offerings that self-insured
employers could purchase. In 2023, Cigna Healthcare added Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health as a covered offering for members in its International Health population (globally mobile individuals and employees of multinational organizations who
reside in the U.S.). Also in 2023, Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health, Omada for Diabetes, and Omada for Hypertension were made available as offerings that additional self-insured employers could purchase through Allegiance (Cigna Healthcare's
third-party administrator). We partner with Cigna Healthcare to execute multi-channel member outreach strategies. We also provide content and strategies to integrate with Cigna Healthcare's and employers' existing outreach channels. For example, we
integrate Omada content with Cigna Healthcare customer communications, newsletters, benefit pages, and other resources. Results for Members Accessing Omada Programs through Cigna Healthcare PROGRAM SATISFACTION In a two-year pilot program for
customers covered by Cigna Healthcare enrolling from 2015 to 2017, 83% of members who responded to a survey delivered at the four-month point of program participation reported that they would recommend the program to a friend. ROI A 2020 study on
Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health conducted by Cigna Healthcare reviewing data from healthcare expenditures submitted through electronic medical claims found an average return on investment for employers of 1.7:1 as of the one-year point of
program participation and 2.7:1 as of the two-year point. WEIGHT LOSS In the same 2020 study on Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health conducted by Cigna Healthcare, members lost an average of 4.1% of their body weight as of the two-year point of
program participation. </FONT></P>

Evernorth added Omada for MSK to the DHF. In 2022, we became the DHF's preferred provider for cardiometabolic programs. Evernorth also included Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health, Omada for Diabetes, and Omada for Hypertension in additional
offerings: as an option for employers to purchase through its condition management program (SafeGuardRx) and as an embedded element of its population health solution (Health Connect 360).1n 2024, Evernorth also included Omada for Prevention &amp;
Weight Health as an element of EncircleRx, its new program designed to help clients manage GLP-1 costs and outcomes.1 Omada has since published research on the impact of Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health on Evernorth members on GLP-1 therapy.
As with Cigna Healthcare, we partner with Evernorth to execute multi-channel member outreach strategies. We also provide content and strategies to integrate with Evernorth's existing outreach channels, including supporting education of pharmacists

&amp; Weight Health: As of December 31, 2024, members who joined Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health during 2024 through Evernorth's SafeguardRx Weight Management Care Value(R) and Diabetes Care Valuesm programs lost approximately 290,000
pounds in the aggregate. Members using Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health alongside GLP-1 Therapy: 43% of members taking GLP-ls who were enrolled in the SafeGuardRx Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health program for at least seven months
lost a minimum of 10% of their body weight, with 1 in 4 of these members achieving over 15% in body weight loss. According to a retrospective propensity-scorematched analysis using pharmacy claims dated October 2022 through May 2023: Members who
were meaningfully engaged in Omada and on a GLP-1 achieved an average of 1.7 times the weight loss compared with those on a GLP-1 who were relatively less engaged. 1 Omada does not prescribe or develop GLP-1 therapies. </FONT></P>

Intermountain is an integrated delivery network, with a fully owned health plan (Select Health) and a value-based management subsidiary (Castell Health). Intermountain Ventures, LLC, an affiliate of Intermountain, purchased shares of our Series D
redeemable convertible preferred stock in August 2019 and is a party to our amended and restated investors' rights agreement. A New Type of Partnership Intermountain has both a mission and financial incentive to improve the health of its patient
populations and its employee "caregivers." Among these populations. Intermountain reports that diabetes and prediabetes contribute heavily to increased costs and decreased quality of life. To complement the impact of its care teams. Intermountain
launched a pilot of Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health for approximately 200 patients in 2016. In 2019, Intermountain expanded coverage of Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health to include employee caregivers, and further expanded the
program in 2020 to cover a larger portion of its patient population. In 2022. Intermountain added Omada for Hypertension for employee caregivers and Omada for Diabetes for both patient and employee caregiver populations. In a new type of
partnership, we have established connections with Intermountain's care teams to help support members with Between-Visit Care that is connected to their care ecosystems. Intermountain's pricing under this partnership includes clinical performance
guarantees, such that Intermountain pays out a percentage withheld when Omada members reach certain levels of engagement and clinical outcomes. We and Intermountain, in partnership with the AMA. have also collaborated on research initiatives and
jointly released a peer-reviewed article in Current Diabetes Reports in 2018. We have partnered closely with Intermountain on outreach over the years, customizing communications for patients and employee caregivers to encourage enrollment in both
populations. For example, we support education for care coordinators from Intermountain's population health subsidiary, who make outbound phone calls and send patient portal messages directly to clinically eligible Intermountain patients to inform
them of their coverage for our programs and encourage engagement. As of December 2024, we have seen enrollment rates and strong weight loss outcomes within the patient population comparable to those of typical employee populations. Key Results for
Intermountain Patients and Employee Caregivers as of December 2024 ENROLLMENT Over 13,500 total patients and employee caregivers have been successfully enrolled in our programs. EMAIL OUTREACH Since launch, 22% of estimated eligible patients
receiving email outreach had enrolled in our programs through Intermountain. WEIGHT LOSS Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health members have lost an average of 6.5 pounds per member since launch. LONG-TERM WEIGHT HEALTH Within the patient
population, through our collaboration with care coordinators, 40% of patients who enrolled in Omada for Prevention &amp; Weight Health from launch through December 2024 and reported weight at baseline and again 12 months later, had achieved at least
5% weight loss at 12 months. </FONT></P>

Center demonstrated this appeal, with 60% of the respondents noting they would be uncomfortable with their own healthcare provider relying on AI to make critical healthcare decisions. We intentionally constructed our technology platform to help
facilitate a trusted relationship between our members and their Care Teams. This ongoing, consistent, human relationship can create a sense of connection as members and Care Teams get to know each other over time. Members appreciate the ability to

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">According to data published in the Annals of Bioethics &amp; Clinical Applications, in 2022, approximately 40% of adults in
the U.S. were living with two or more chronic conditions, which can leave many individuals to struggle with a healthcare system that treats each one of their issues separately. The CDC reported in 2023 that people with diabetes were more than twice
as likely to experience depression; a 2019 study published in the <I>Journal of Back and Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation </I>found that 58% of people with diabetes also experienced an MSK condition; and a 2021 study published in <I>Endotext</I> found
that approximately 74% of adults with diabetes also had hypertension. We have carefully selected the conditions that we treat in an effort to address significant areas of comorbidity in an integrated member experience with one provider. We are able
to deliver care to members diagnosed with prediabetes, obesity, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and hypertension; members taking <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> therapy; and members who suffer from MSK conditions. Additionally, all members
may receive additional support for behavioral health challenges from anxiety or stress to depression to promote overall wellbeing and support their physical and mental health. We believe that our members appreciate that we look beyond their primary
condition to support them in their journey towards health. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Much like our members, our customers and channel partners are
also increasingly seeking multi-condition solutions. According to the 2023 Segal Health Plan Cost Trend Survey, employers may work with as many as ten different vendors to construct their health and wellness portfolio and to construct a health
benefits offering that meets their needs. Segal further expects this to prompt plan sponsors to look for integrated solutions from their current health provider network and PBM carriers to replace multiple, separate contracts. We see this desire to

impact of our programs and their value for customers and channel partners. Our publications include findings from our randomized controlled trial, which we observe to be a rarity in the digital health space and in our competitive set. Our programs
also hold certifications and accreditations from relevant medical associations or accreditation bodies, which underscore their quality and safety. We believe this commitment to clinical quality strongly aligns with what customers and channel
partners expect from a virtual care provider. Among our primary competitors (named below), our Diabetes and combined Diabetes and Hypertension programs were the first type 2 diabetes programs to be awarded NCQA&#146;s PHP accreditation in March
2021, and ours was the first MSK program to be awarded URAC&#146;s Telehealth accreditation in August&nbsp;2023. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Our

than 2,000 customers as of March&nbsp;31, 2025, and we believe there is still a significant opportunity for us to grow our number of covered lives through existing channels. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, during 2023, 305&nbsp;million people
had health insurance. As of December 2024, our existing health plan partners provided health insurance for 156&nbsp;million lives across their networks. That population, combined with our other current customers as of December&nbsp;31, 2024,
represented an estimated 20&nbsp;million individuals with benefits coverage for one or more Omada programs, where they have a clinical need. In addition, according to the two large PBMs that are our channel partners, those PBMs provided pharmacy
benefits to over 200 million individuals as of March 2024. Those PBMs currently cover our programs for only a small portion of this population, and although the populations covered by our various channel partners may overlap, we believe there is
significant opportunity for us to increase the number of covered lives we serve through PBM partnerships. Together, these lines of business present a large opportunity for us to expand within current channels by selling to more self-insured and
fully insured employers and expanding to new lines of business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We also see opportunity with new channels and in lines of
business where we have yet to place significant focus, such as Medicare Advantage and fully insured lines of business, and we believe there is potential for growth in our more nascent channels including health systems and government programs, such
as the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. We believe our proven outcomes and value proposition will resonate with these buyers similar to how they have resonated within our core markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Additionally, while Omada does not develop or prescribe GLP-1 therapies, we expect the attention and focus that <FONT

those who do not, will help accelerate our growth. Our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> Care Tracks, which are offered only to members enrolled in an Omada cardiometabolic program, build on outcomes from our existing programs. These
offerings leverage our experience driving healthy behavior change for over a decade and represent a significant growth opportunity as customers and channel partners look for ways to both support their populations and manage their costs. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We have seen significant uptake of our multi-condition offering, both from existing customers and channel partners who
initially entered into contracts for one program but later added others and from new customers and channel partners who enter into contracts for multi-condition solutions from day one. We believe there is still opportunity to continue
multi-condition expansion. As of December&nbsp;31, 2024, approximately 31% of our customers offered more than one Omada program, which leaves a sizable opportunity to sell additional programs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Additionally, we believe that delivering our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> Care Tracks to support people
taking this novel class of drugs presents a significant opportunity, particularly for individuals with the chronic conditions we serve. Given the FDA&#146;s label recommendation as of December&nbsp;31, 2024 for
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> use as an adjunct to diet and exercise, we may see new interest from customers and channel partners with access to Omada programs. As <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1</FONT> coverage increases over
time, we believe our value proposition positions us to capitalize on the long-term tailwinds in this growing market, as we believe many of our accounts who are covering <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GLP-1s</FONT> for obesity would value a
lifestyle intervention alongside. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Increase Member Enrollment </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">As of December&nbsp;31, 2024, we estimate that 20&nbsp;million individuals had benefits coverage for one or more Omada
programs through their employers, health plans, PBMs, health systems, or other customers, where they have a clinical need. Having served over one million members since launch, there is still significant opportunity to enroll more members, and future
efforts in a number of areas could increase enrollment rates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We are focused on achieving higher enrollment rates by
helping more customers and channel partners adopt our outreach best practices, including enabling <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Omada-led</FONT> outreach campaigns, implementing strategies to reach individuals with known risk, and evaluating new
enrollment strategies and channels. We also have a strong outreach optimization engine, and we continuously work to iterate and improve our tactics to drive higher enrollment rates. As the general state of AI and ML technology continues to evolve,
we plan to evaluate new ways in which these technologies could further optimize our outreach strategies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Additionally, we
can collaborate with other healthcare providers to expand awareness and potentially increase member enrollment. Through collaboration, providers can recommend that individuals enroll in our programs where consistent with their treatment guidance for
patients, further promoting awareness of our programs from within these trusted relationships. We currently work with some healthcare providers in this manner, but there may be more opportunity to increase enrollments through similar collaborations.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We can also leverage other new and innovative strategies to expand awareness of our programs. For example, our recently
announced partnership with a large online retailer provides us with an additional pathway to increase awareness among millions of potential members who may have Omada covered as a benefit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Enhance Member Engagement Within Existing Customer Base </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Given the engagement-based pricing models that we offer for cardiometabolic programs, increased member engagement can drive
significant growth going forward. In 2024, more than 55% of members still engaged with our cardiometabolic programs at least once per month after a year in the program. Our data, Care Teams, and technology power our ability to drive increased
engagement, through frequent touchpoints, reminders, and progress tracking tools. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">General advancements in AI and ML also
may present opportunities for us to more effectively and efficiently interact and engage with our members. Recent AI and ML improvements that we have launched, including processes for automatically tagging and categorizing messages from members for
our Care Teams, smart content recommendations that help surface relevant resources from our library for members, and computer vision form assessments, each described earlier in this document, focus on driving more frequent engagement with members
across the platform. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the &#147;AKS&#148;) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering,
paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made
under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The AKS includes statutory
exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. Failure to meet the requirements of a safe harbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">case-by-case</FONT></FONT> basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances, including the parties&#146; intent and the arrangement&#146;s potential for abuse, and arrangements may be

relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing designated health services (&#147;DHS&#148;) from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS,
unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is violated if the financial arrangement does not meet an applicable exception, regardless of any
intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The
Federal False Claims Act (the &#147;FCA&#148;) prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government or from making a false statement or using a false record

that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the AKS or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA. Penalties for a violation of the FCA include fines for each false claim, plus up

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In the U.S., there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes
to the healthcare system, many of which are intended to contain or reduce healthcare costs. By way of example, the Affordable Care Act (the &#147;ACA&#148;) substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private
insurers. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June&nbsp;17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without
specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In addition, the ACA requires (with limited exceptions) that
private health plans cover certain recommended preventive services without imposing member cost-sharing. For these purposes, &#147;preventive services&#148; refer to services selected by certain agencies, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force. Qualified health plans for individuals and the small-group market must also cover certain &#147;essential benefits,&#148; including chronic disease management, although those plans may meet that ACA requirement with other services and are not
required to cover Omada&#146;s programs specifically. Any changes to these coverage requirements and/or cost-sharing prohibitions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Separately, individuals covered by high-deductible health plans may receive preventive care, including certain preventive
services identified by agencies like the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and certain other items identified by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;), without cost-sharing, even if the high deductible has not yet been met, while
remaining eligible to make health savings account (&#147;HSA&#148;) contributions. High-deductible health plan participants may also receive disease management or wellness programs that do not provide significant benefits in the nature of medical
care or treatment, without cost-sharing, even if the high deductible has not yet been met, while remaining eligible to make HSA contributions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Recently, the ACA&#146;s delegation to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to recommend preventive services for
ACA-compliant plans was challenged in <I>Braidwood Management Inc., et al. v. Xavier Becerra, et al.</I> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with the lower court that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&#146;s recommendations
were not binding. As a result, ACA-compliant plans would not be required to cover preventive services without cost-sharing. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to review the decision. Regardless of the U.S. Supreme Court&#146;s decision with respect
to whether the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are mandatory for ACA-compliant plans, the IRS has issued guidance indicating that those same recommended services will continue to be considered preventive care that does not affect
HSA eligibility for a high-deductible plan participant. Nevertheless, any future changes to this guidance or to the types of care that high-deductible health plan participants may receive without cost-sharing may require us to collect cost-sharing
for those individuals, cause fewer customers and channel partners to make our programs available, cause fewer covered individuals to choose to enroll in our programs, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, and we
expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payers will pay for healthcare products and services.

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Numerous state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality,
and security of health-related and other personal information. In the U.S., federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, such as HIPAA, and federal and state consumer
protection laws and regulations, such as Section&nbsp;5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations
of our partners. In addition, certain state and foreign laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, &#147;CCPA&#148;), govern the privacy and security of personal information,
including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure
to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with
each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">For example, HIPAA imposes privacy, security, and breach notification obligations on certain healthcare providers, health
plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on
behalf of such covered entities, and their covered subcontractors. Entities found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information (&#147;PHI&#148;), a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;) may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution
agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance.</FONT> While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations
of HIPAA, HIPAA authorizes state Attorneys General to file suit on behalf of their residents, and its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of
PHI. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>U.S. Food and Drug Administration </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The FDA regulates medical or health-related software, including machine learning functionality and predictive algorithms, if
such software falls within the definition of a &#147;medical device&#148; under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &#147;FDCA&#148;). Historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion for certain
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-risk</FONT> software functions and has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the regulation of certain software functionality as a medical device. In addition, the FDCA excludes certain
types of software from the definition of a medical device, including certain medical-related software used for administrative support at a healthcare facility, software intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle, certain software
designed to store electronic health records, software for transferring, storing, or displaying medical device data or in vitro diagnostic data, and certain clinical decision support software. We believe our current software applications for our Care
Teams generally provide clinical decision support functionality that is exempt from the FDCA&#146;s definition of a &#147;medical device.&#148; Our current software applications and AI technologies only deliver recommendations directly to members in

an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a premarket approval application (&#147;PMA&#148;). Under the FDCA, medical devices are
classified into one of three classes&#151;Class&nbsp;I, Class&nbsp;II, or Class&nbsp;III&#151;depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and
effectiveness. Class&nbsp;I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA&#146;s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the
applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (&#147;QSR&#148;), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> labeling, advertising,
and promotional materials. Class&nbsp;II devices are subject to the FDA&#146;s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance
standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidance documents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">While most Class&nbsp;I devices are
exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class&nbsp;II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section&nbsp;510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute
the device. The FDA&#146;s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining,
life-supporting, or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class&nbsp;III, requiring approval of a PMA.

be effective on the day immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. The ESPP is designed to allow our eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock, at semi-annual intervals,
with their accumulated payroll deductions. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an &#147;employee stock purchase plan&#148; under Section 423 of the Code. The material terms of the ESPP, as it is currently contemplated, are summarized below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><I>Components</I>. The ESPP is comprised of two distinct components in order to provide increased flexibility to grant options
to purchase shares under the ESPP to U.S. and to non-U.S. employees. Specifically, the ESPP authorizes (i) the grant of options to U.S. employees that are intended to qualify for favorable U.S. federal tax treatment under Section 423 of the Code,
(the &#147;Section 423 Component&#148;), and (ii) the grant of options that are not intended to be tax-qualified under Section 423 of the Code to facilitate participation for employees who do not benefit from favorable U.S. tax treatment and to
provide flexibility to comply with non-U.S. law and other considerations (the &#147;Non-Section 423 Component&#148;). Where possible under local law and custom, we expect that the Non-Section 423 Component generally will be operated and administered
on terms and conditions similar to the Section 423 Component. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><I>Administration</I>. Subject to the terms and conditions
of the ESPP, our compensation committee will administer the ESPP. Our compensation committee can delegate administrative tasks under the ESPP to the services of an agent and/or employees to assist in the administration of the ESPP. The administrator
will have the discretionary authority to administer and interpret the ESPP. Interpretations and constructions of the administrator of any provision of the ESPP or of any rights thereunder will be conclusive and binding on all persons. We will bear
all expenses and liabilities incurred by the ESPP administrator. </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><I>Share Reserve</I>. The maximum number of shares
of our common stock which will be authorized for sale under the ESPP is equal to the sum of (a) 1,121,231 shares of common stock and (b) an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning in 2026 and ending in 2035, equal to the

shares. </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><I>Eligibility</I>. Employees eligible to participate in the ESPP for a given offering period generally
include employees who are employed by us or one of our subsidiaries on the first day of the offering period, or the enrollment date. Our administrator has the discretion to exclude from participation our employees (and, if applicable, any employees
of our subsidiaries) who customarily work less than five months in a calendar year or are customarily scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week. Finally, an employee who owns (or is deemed to own through attribution) 5% or more of the combined
voting power or value of all our classes of stock or of one of our subsidiaries will not be allowed to participate in the ESPP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><I>Participation</I>. Employees will enroll under the ESPP by completing a payroll deduction form permitting the deduction
from their compensation of at least 1% of their compensation but not more than the lesser of 15% of their compensation. Such payroll deductions will be expressed as a whole number percentage, and the accumulated deductions will be applied to the
purchase of shares of our common stock on each purchase date. However, a participant may not purchase more than 666 shares of our common stock in each offering period and may not subscribe for more than $25,000 in fair market value of shares of our
common stock (determined at the time the option is granted) during any calendar year. The ESPP administrator has the authority to change these limitations for any subsequent offering period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><I>Offering</I>. Generally, the ESPP will offer employees the option to purchase shares through a series of offering periods.
The length of the offering periods under the ESPP will be determined by the plan administrator and may be up to 27 months long. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The option purchase price will be the lower of 85% of the closing trading price per share of our common stock on the first
trading date of an offering period in which a participant is enrolled or 85% of the closing trading price per share on the purchase date, which will occur on the last trading day of each purchase period, or such other price designated by the
administrator. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Unless a participant has previously canceled his or her participation in the ESPP before the purchase
date, the participant will be deemed to have exercised his or her option in full as of each purchase date. Upon exercise, the participant will purchase the number of whole shares that his or her accumulated payroll deductions will buy at the option
purchase price, subject to the participation limitations listed above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">A participant may cancel his or her payroll
deduction authorization at any time prior to the end of the offering period. Upon cancellation, the participant will have the option to either (i) receive a refund of the participant&#146;s account balance in cash without interest or (ii) exercise
the participant&#146;s option for the current offering period for the maximum number of shares of our common stock on the applicable purchase date, with the remaining account balance refunded in cash without interest. Following at least one payroll
deduction, a participant may also decrease (but not increase) his or her payroll deduction authorization once during any offering period. If a participant suspends his or her payroll deductions during an offering period, such participant&#146;s
cumulative unapplied payroll deductions prior to the suspension (if any) shall remain in his or her account and shall be applied to the purchase of shares on the next occurring purchase date. If a participant wants to increase or decrease the rate
of payroll withholding, he or she may do so effective for the next offering period by submitting a new form before the offering period for which such change is to be effective. </P>

only by such participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge, or other disposition will not be given effect. </P>

other increase or decrease in the number of shares of our common stock effected without receipt of consideration by us, we will proportionately adjust the aggregate number of shares of our common stock offered under the ESPP, the number and price of
shares of our common stock which any participant has elected to purchase under the ESPP, and the maximum number of shares of our common stock which a participant may elect to purchase in any single offering period. If there is a proposal to dissolve
or liquidate us, then the ESPP will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed dissolution or liquidation, and any offering period then in progress will be shortened by setting a new purchase date to take place before the date
of our dissolution or liquidation. We will notify each participant of such change in writing at least ten business days prior to the new exercise date. If we undergo a merger with or into another corporation or sell all or substantially all of our
assets, each outstanding option will be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation or the parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. If the successor corporation refuses to assume the outstanding options or

Regulation <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-K</FONT> under the Securities Act, any transaction, arrangement, or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements, or relationships, in which we were or are to be a participant, where
the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, including without limitation purchases of goods or services by or from the related person or entities in which the related person has
a material interest, indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, and employment by us of a related person. In reviewing and approving any such transactions, our audit committee is tasked to consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including but
not limited to whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in an arm&#146;s length transaction with an unrelated third party and the extent of the related person&#146;s interest in the transaction. All of the

These provisions are also designed to reduce our vulnerability to hostile takeovers and to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the
effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and may have the effect of delaying changes in control or management of our company. As a consequence, these provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our
stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. We believe that the benefits of these provisions, including increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to

exercisable for our common stock are subject to restrictions contained in market standoff agreements with us that include restrictions on the sale, transfer, or other disposition of shares during the restricted period. The forms and specific
restrictive provisions within these market standoff provisions vary among security holders. For example, although some of these market standoff agreements do not specifically restrict hedging transactions and others may be subject to different
interpretations between us and security holders as to whether they restrict hedging, our insider trading policy prohibits hedging by all of our current directors, officers, and employees. Sales, short sales, or hedging transactions involving our

or otherwise affect the price of the common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is
no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the over-allotment option. The underwriters can close out a covered short sale by exercising the over-allotment option or purchasing shares in the open market. In
determining the source of shares to close out a covered short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market price of shares compared to the price available under the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also sell
shares in excess of the over-allotment option, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters
are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the
underwriters may bid for, and purchase, shares of common stock in the open market to stabilize the price of the common stock. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of the common stock above independent market levels or prevent or
retard a decline in the market price of the common stock. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. </P>

is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P>

accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

and variable consideration, the period of benefit for deferred commissions, the fair value of common stock warrants, the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants, the valuation and assumptions underlying share-based compensation

positions, and the incremental borrowing rate used in the Company&#146;s operating lease calculations. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company

has issued redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants which are classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets because the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants are freestanding financial instruments
that may require the Company to transfer assets upon exercise, and the common stock warrants contain a term that may require adjustment to the exercise price. The liability associated with each of these warrants was initially recorded at fair value

contractual term of the warrants. The dividend yield is estimated at 0% based on the expected dividend yield as the Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. </P>

consideration it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods and services. Under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#147;ASC 606&#148;), the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract
with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, a performance
obligation is satisfied. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The Company generates revenue primarily by providing access to virtual care programs to
customers&#146; members, which is referred to as services revenue. The services revenue is recognized over the period the Company is obligated to perform services for that member. The Company&#146;s customers are business entities, such as health
plans and self-insured employers, that have contracted with the Company to offer the virtual care programs to their covered lives. Covered lives, such as employees or their covered dependents, that are enrolled in a program are referred to as
members. In the virtual care programs, Care Teams implement clinically validated behavior change protocols over the term of the program for individuals living with chronic conditions, such as cardiometabolic conditions, or living with MSK
conditions. Cardiometabolic virtual care programs are also supported by one or more connected third-party devices, which are provided to the members upon enrollment in the programs. The Company accounts for each member enrollment as a separate
contract under ASC 606. The Company&#146;s agreements typically provide a termination for convenience by either party, with a notice period generally ranging from 30 to 180 days. The Company typically bills for its services monthly, in arrears, and
the transaction price is net of sales tax collected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The Company sells to its customers through its direct sales force

administrative or marketing fee for their services, and the Company engages directly with its customers with respect to the provision of its services. The Company&#146;s customer acquisition teams work directly with customers on onboarding and
enrollment processes for new members. While health plans are customers for their fully insured populations, they also serve as distribution channels to self-insured entities that contract with the Company through its relationship with the health

grant date. The Company&#146;s equity incentive plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards to employees, consultants, officers, and directors. Share-based compensation expense is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period of the award). The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued to employees on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which is impacted by the estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock, as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These
variables are summarized as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><I>Fair value of common stock</I> &#150; Due to the absence of an active market for
the Company&#146;s common stock, the fair value of the common stock underlying the Company&#146;s share-based awards is determined by the Company&#146;s board of directors, with input from management and the assistance of a third-party valuation
firm. Because there is no public market for the Company&#146;s stock, the independent third-party valuations have generally been performed annually in accordance with the guidance outlined in the AICPA Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held
Company Equity Securities Issued as compensation (&#147;AICPA&#146;s Practice Aid&#148;). In conducting the valuations, the independent third-party valuation specialist considered all objective and subjective factors that it believed to be relevant
for each valuation conducted in accordance with AICPA&#146;s Practice Aid, including the price paid by investors for the Company&#146;s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock, actual and forecasted operating and financial performance,
market conditions, performance of comparable publicly-traded companies and transactions of comparable companies, developments and milestones within the Company, the rights, preferences, and privileges of the Company&#146;s common and redeemable
convertible preferred stock, and the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In determining the fair value
of the Company&#146;s common stock, the fair value of the Company&#146;s business was determined using various valuation methods, including combinations of the income approach (discounted cash flow method) and the market approach (public company
market-multiple method) with input from the Company. The income approach involves applying an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to projected cash flows based on forecasted revenue and costs. The market approach estimates value based on a
comparison of the Company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market-value multiple was determined, which was applied to the Company&#146;s operating results to estimate the
enterprise value of the Company. </P>

redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities and common stock warrant liabilities associated with warrants issued in connection with the Company&#146;s financing arrangements (refer to Note 6 and Note 11 for additional information).
The fair values of the outstanding warrants are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Inputs used to determine estimated fair value include the estimated fair value of the underlying stock at the valuation measurement date, the
remaining contractual term of the warrants, risk-free interest rates, expected dividends, and the expected volatility of the underlying stock. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its fair value based on Level 2 inputs as the principal
amounts outstanding are subject to variable interest rates that are based on market rates (see Note 6, &#147;Financing Arrangements&#148;). </P>

have been presented outside of permanent equity. The Company recorded all shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock at their respective issuance price less issuance costs on the dates of issuance. Given the Company&#146;s performance and
financial condition, the Company currently does not believe a Liquidation Event is probable. The carrying values of the Company&#146;s redeemable convertible preferred stock have not been accreted to their redemption values as the Liquidation Event
is not considered probable of occurring. Subsequent adjustments of the carrying values to redemption values will be made only if and when it becomes probable the redeemable convertible preferred stock will become redeemable. </P>

Silicon Valley Bank (&#147;SVB&#148;). The number of shares that the holder may purchase is equal to 43,420 and is related to a borrowing under the agreement. The warrants will be automatically exercised under the cashless exercise method upon the
expiration date of each respective warrant or upon a cash or public acquisition. The warrants issued allow SVB to acquire shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.24&nbsp;per share and expire ten years after issuance. These warrants were
concluded to be liabilities accounted for at fair value, using the Black-Scholes pricing model, on the date of issuance with subsequent remeasurements recorded in earnings. The fair value on the date of issuance was recorded as warrant liabilities
and debt discount. The debt discount was fully amortized upon the debt being repaid in May 2020. The change in fair value for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024 was a loss of $0.1&nbsp;million and a gain of less than $0.1&nbsp;million,

its parents, or subsidiaries and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors of the Company. Stock options granted under the 2011 Plan generally expire within ten years from the date of grant, vest over four years, and are

service, as applicable, may exercise stock options for a period of up to two years from the date of termination, service providers with a tenure of four years of employment or other service may exercise stock options for a period of up to three
years from the date of termination, and service providers with a tenure of five years or more may exercise stock options for a period of up to four years from the date of termination. In December 2021, the Company amended the 2011 Plan to remove
extended post-termination exercise periods and revert to the traditional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">90-day</FONT> period for future stock option grants. </P>

negative evidence pursuant to the requirements of ASC 740, Income Taxes, including current and historical results of operations, future income projections, and potential tax planning strategies. A significant piece of objective negative evidence
evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as its projections for future growth. On the basis of this
evaluation, as of December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, a full valuation allowance has been established. </P>

shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-class</FONT> method determines net income (loss) per share of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared
or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-class</FONT> method requires income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and
participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been distributed. The holders of the Company&#146;s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in
preference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any remaining earnings would be distributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock pro rata on an <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period using the treasury stock
method or the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">if-converted</FONT> method. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive
securities are anti-dilutive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">For the calculation of diluted net loss per share, net loss per share attributable to
common stockholders for basic net loss per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under the 2011 Plan. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net loss
attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, the Company&#146;s potentially dilutive shares relating to stock options, redeemable
convertible preferred stock, redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants, and common stock warrants were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect of including these shares in the calculation would have been

connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the conversion ratio for the Company&#146;s outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock was proportionately adjusted such that the common stock issuable upon conversion of such preferred stock was
decreased in proportion to the Reverse Stock Split. All references to common stock, common stock warrants, and options to purchase common stock share data, per share data, and related information contained in the consolidated financial statements

&#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Omada&#148;) mission is to bend disease curves. As part of that mission, the Company strives to inspire and enable people to make lasting health changes on their own terms. The Company delivers virtual care between
doctor&#146;s visits, providing an engaging, personalized, and integrated experience for its members that is designed to improve their health while delivering value for its customers and channel partners, including employers, health plans, health
systems, and pharmacy benefits managers (&#147;PBMs&#148;). The Company offers cardiometabolic programs for prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension; a physical therapy program to address musculoskeletal (&#147;MSK&#148;) conditions; additional
support for members taking glucagon-like <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">peptide-1</FONT> agonists <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(&#147;GLP-1&#148;)</FONT> in its cardiometabolic programs <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(&#147;GLP-1</FONT> Care

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">On May&nbsp;27, 2025, the Company amended its restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock
split of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock on a one-for-three basis (the &#147;Reverse Stock Split&#148;). The common stock warrants and options to purchase common stock were subsequently adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. All
impacted share and per-share information included in these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Omada Health Inc., its subsidiary, Physera, Inc., and a professional corporation, Physera Physical Therapy Group, PC
(&#147;PPTG&#148; or the &#147;professional corporation&#148;), which was determined to be a variable interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;) for which Omada is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and reflect, in the opinion of management, all the adjustments of a normal, recurring
nature that are necessary for the fair statement of the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods but are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or any other
period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><B><I>Variable Interest Entity </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Some jurisdictions have laws that prohibit business entities, such as Omada, from practicing physical therapy, employing
physical therapists, exercising control over certain decisions by physical therapists (collectively known as the corporate practice of physical therapy), or engaging in certain arrangements with physical therapists, such as <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">fee-splitting.</FONT> The Company operates in accordance with these restrictions by holding a variable interest through a long-term management agreement in a professional corporation, which is owned and operated by
physical therapists and which engages in provision of physical therapy and contracts with physical therapists and other healthcare practitioners duly licensed to practice and provide physical therapy services and treatment. The most recent long-term
agreement commenced in January 2022, has an initial term of ten years, and is automatically renewable for successive periods of five-year terms unless terminated by either party for cause. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The management agreement is not terminable by the professional corporation
during the initial term, except in the case of material breach or bankruptcy of Omada. The professional corporation is considered a VIE since it does not have sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support. An enterprise having a controlling financial interest in a VIE must consolidate the VIE if it is considered the primary beneficiary, which is described as having both (1)&nbsp;the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE&#146;s economic performance and (2)&nbsp;the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to
the VIE. Through the management agreement and the Company&#146;s relationship with the stockholders of the professional corporation, the Company has exclusive authority over all <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-medical</FONT> decision making
related to the ongoing business operations of the professional corporation. Based on the provisions of the agreements with the professional corporation, the Company consolidated the VIE at inception, and upon reconsideration events, as the Company
is considered the primary beneficiary as the Company has control over the operations of the VIE, provides full financial and management support, and takes all residual benefits and bears all residual losses from its operations. The Company will
perform <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-going</FONT> reassessments of the VIE based on any reconsideration events to reevaluate whether a change to the consolidation conclusion is required each reporting period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2024 and March&nbsp;31, 2025 include assets of the
consolidated VIE, which can only be used to settle obligations of the VIE, and liabilities of the consolidated VIE. As of December&nbsp;31, 2024, after the elimination of intercompany transaction balances, assets of the consolidated VIE totaled
$0.9&nbsp;million, and liabilities of the consolidated VIE totaled $0.2&nbsp;million. As of March&nbsp;31, 2025, after the elimination of intercompany transaction balances, assets of the consolidated VIE totaled $1.0&nbsp;million, and liabilities of
the consolidated VIE totaled $0.2&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><B><I>Use of Estimates </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense
during the reporting period. The Company&#146;s significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, determining standalone selling price for performance
obligations in contracts with customers and variable consideration, the period of benefit for deferred commissions, the fair value of common stock warrants, the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants, the valuation and
assumptions underlying share-based compensation including the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-share</FONT> fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock, the assessment of useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, the valuation of
deferred tax assets, reserves for uncertain tax positions, and the incremental borrowing rate used in the Company&#146;s operating lease calculations. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results
could differ from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><B><I>Segment and Geographic Information </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The Company considers operating segments to be components of the Company in which separate financial information is available
and is evaluated regularly by the Company&#146;s chief operating decision maker (&#147;CODM&#148;) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM for the Company is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM reviews
financial information on a consolidated basis to make decisions about how to allocate resources and how to measure the Company&#146;s performance. The Company has determined that it has one operating and reportable segment (refer to Note 11 for
additional information). </P>

principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company holds cash at major financial institutions that often exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. The Company manages its credit risk associated with cash
concentrations by concentrating its cash deposits in high quality financial institutions and by periodically evaluating the credit quality of the primary financial institutions holding such deposits. The carrying value of cash approximates fair
value. Historically, the Company has not experienced any losses due to such cash concentrations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to accounts receivable are primarily limited to certain customers and channel partners to which the Company makes substantial sales. Significant customers and channel partners are those which represent 10% or more of the accounts
receivable balance or revenue for the periods presented. Customers and channel partners that accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable, net as of December&nbsp;31, 2024 and March&nbsp;31, 2025 or 10% or more of revenue for the three months

fair values of the outstanding warrants are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Inputs used to determine estimated fair value include the estimated fair value of the underlying stock at the valuation measurement date, the
remaining contractual term of the warrants, risk-free interest rates, expected dividends, and the expected volatility of the underlying stock. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its fair value based on Level&nbsp;2 inputs as the
principal amounts outstanding are subject to variable interest rates that are based on market rates (see Note 5, &#147;Financing Arrangements&#148;). </P>

provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and officers as well as other employees and individuals against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed actions, suits, or proceedings in which such person is made a party by reason of such person being or having been a director, officer, employee, or agent to the registrant. The Delaware
General Corporation Law provides that Section&nbsp;145 is not exclusive of other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The
registrant&#146;s restated certificate of incorporation provides for indemnification by the registrant of its directors, officers, and employees to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. The registrant has entered into
indemnification agreements with each of its current directors, executive officers, and certain other officers to provide these directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in the
registrant&#146;s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections. </P>

incorporation that a director or officer of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, except for liability (i)&nbsp;for any
breach of the director&#146;s or officer&#146;s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)&nbsp;in the case
of directors, for unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, redemptions, or other distributions, or (iv)&nbsp;for any transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit; provided that officers may
not be indemnified for actions by or in the right of the corporation. The registrant&#146;s restated certificate of incorporation provides for such limitation of liability. </P>
